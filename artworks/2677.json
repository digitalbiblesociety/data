The Prix de Rome was a French scholarship for arts students, particularly painters and sculptors, that was established during the 17th century. Winning this award was a significant accomplishment, as it provided the recipient with the opportunity to study in Rome at the expense of the French state. This experience often played a crucial role in the artistic development and future success of the laureates. Henri Frédéric Schopin's win in 1831 thus marked a significant milestone in his artistic journey, positioning him among the distinguished ranks of artists who had received this esteemed accolade. He passed away on 21 October 1880, leaving behind a legacy enriched by his artistic contributions and achievements.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Schopin","url_wga":"https://www.wga.hu/html/s/schopin/","nationality":"British"}}
