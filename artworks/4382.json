Born into a family of painters, he was the great-nephew of Palma Vecchio (\"Old Palma\") and the son of Antonio Nigreti, a minor painter in Palma Vecchio's workshop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn in Venice between 1548 and 1550, Palma Giovane's career took a significant turn following Tintoretto's death in 1594, as he became the leading artist in Venice, perpetuating Tintoretto's style. His work extended beyond Venice, with commissions in Bergamo and Central Europe, most notably from Emperor Rudolph II in Prague.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePalma Giovane's early training included making copies of Titian's works, shaping his style. His talent was recognized by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino, who supported him and sent him to Rome around 1567. Returning to Venice circa 1572, he adopted Tintoretto's mannerisms and was even believed to have been a part of Titian's workshop, completing Titian's last work, the 'Piet√†', after his death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis major commissions included three scenes for the Doge's Palace after a fire in 1577, where he worked alongside Veronese and Tintoretto. From 1580-1590, he painted large canvas cycles for Venetian Schools and sacred buildings, which are considered among his best works. After 1594, he became a prominent figure in Venice, leading a large studio and producing numerous religious and allegorical paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePalma Giovane also painted mythologies for intellectuals post-1600 and created a magnificent portrait of Saint Pope Pius V, now in the Chianciano Museum of Art. He passed away on October 14, 1628, and was buried in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. His influence extended to artists like the Brescian painter Camillo Rama, and his legacy as a leading painter in Venice endures to this day.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_il_Giovane","url_wga":"https://www.wga.hu/html/p/palma/giovane/1/","nationality":"Italian"}}
