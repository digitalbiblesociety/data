This tiny country composed of a mainland portion plus five inhabited islands is one of the smallest on the African continent. President Teodoro Obiang NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991 the 1996 2002 and 2009 presidential elections - as well as the 1999 2004 2008 and 2013 legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president exerts almost total control over the political system and has discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil reserves and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall from oil production resulting in a massive increase in government revenue in recent years improvements in the population's living standards have been slow to develop.","overview":"Equatorial Guinea is a Central African country comprising the Rio Muni mainland and 5 volcanic offshore islands. Capital Malabo on Bioko Island has Spanish colonial architecture and is a hub for the country’s prosperous oil industry. Its Arena Blanca beach draws dry-season butterflies. The tropical forest of the mainland’s Monte Alen National Park is home to gorillas chimpanzees and elephants.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":19,"land_mass_km":28050,"population_christian":683000,"population_christian_percentage":88.7,"population_catholic_percentage":80.7,"population_protestant_percentage":8,"population_refugee":null,"population_migration":16000,"population_year_change":3.47,"population_density_km":50,"population_average_age":22,"population_urban_percentage":73,"population_literacy_percentage":"88.00","landmass":null,"region_code":8,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","languages":[{"iso":"bng","glotto_id":"beng1282","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Benga","autonym":"bɛŋga","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and São Tomé e Príncipe","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GQ","latitude":"0.889700","longitude":"9.403360","population":5500,"status_id":"6b","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"bnm","glotto_id":"bata1285","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Batanga","autonym":"Noho","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Southwestern Cameroon","area":"Also in Cameroon.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GQ","latitude":"2.087080","longitude":"9.751075","population":15000,"status_id":"6b","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"bvb","glotto_id":"bube1242","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Bube","autonym":"Adeeyah","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and São Tomé e Príncipe","area":"Biombo Island, Fernando Po.","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GQ","latitude":"3.536380","longitude":"8.689290","population":61000,"status_id":"5","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"bxc","glotto_id":"mole1238","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Molengue","autonym":"Molengue","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and São Tomé e Príncipe","area":null,"progress":"\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GQ","latitude":"1.371800","longitude":"9.612890","population":0,"status_id":"7","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"fab","glotto_id":"fada1250","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Fa d'Ambu","autonym":"Fa d’Ambu","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and São Tomé e Príncipe","area":"Annobón Island, isolated from mainland by 360 km of ocean (2,000); Bioko Island, Malabo (500), a few on continental Equatorial Guinea.
