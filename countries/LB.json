The French demarcated the region of Lebanon in 1920 and granted this area independence in 1943. Since independence the country has been marked by periods of political turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on its position as a regional center for finance and trade. The country's 1975-90 civil war that resulted in an estimated 120000 fatalities was followed by years of social and political instability. Sectarianism is a key element of Lebanese political life. Neighboring Syria has long influenced Lebanon's foreign policy and internal policies and its military occupied Lebanon from 1976 until 2005. The Lebanon-based Hizballah militia and Israel continued attacks and counterattacks against each other after Syria's withdrawal and fought a brief war in 2006. Lebanon's borders with Syria and Israel remain unresolved.","overview":"Lebanon officially known as the Lebanese Republic is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea.","independent":1,"population_refugee":1395952,"population_literacy_percentage":94,"region_id":145,"region_name":"Western Asia","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Lebanon","url_national_society":"https://www.biblesociety.org.lb/","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/LBN","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Middle_East/Lebanon","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/lebanon","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/LB","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/lebanon.html","country_languages":[{"iso":"acm","population":26470,"name":"Mesopotamian Arabic","autonym":"Iraqi Arabic","bibles_count":0,"films_count":6,"resource_count":11},{"iso":"aii","population":0,"name":"Assyrian Neo-Aramaic","autonym":"Sūreṯ","bibles_count":4,"films_count":2,"resource_count":2},{"iso":"ajp","population":428000,"name":"South Levantine Arabic","autonym":"اللهجة الشامية الجنوبية","bibles_count":1,"films_count":39,"resource_count":40},{"iso":"amw","population":35420,"name":"Western Neo-Aramaic","autonym":"Sūryān","bibles_count":1,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"apc","population":4100000,"name":"North Levantine Arabic","autonym":"اللهجة الشامي الشمال","bibles_count":2,"films_count":8,"resource_count":13},{"iso":"arb","population":0,"name":"Arabic","autonym":"عربي فصيح","bibles_count":23,"films_count":3,"resource_count":1506},{"iso":"arz","population":102680,"name":"Egyptian Arabic","autonym":"اللهجه المصريه","bibles_count":2,"films_count":47,"resource_count":50},{"iso":"avl","population":67910,"name":"Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Arabic","autonym":"Bedawi","bibles_count":0,"films_count":1,"resource_count":2},{"iso":"cld","population":28600,"name":"Chaldean Neo-Aramaic","autonym":"Sūreṯ","bibles_count":2,"films_count":2,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"ell","population":6390,"name":"Modern Greek (1453-)","autonym":"Νέα Ελληνικά","bibles_count":24,"films_count":3,"resource_count":7},{"iso":"eng","population":10340,"name":"English","autonym":"","bibles_count":243,"films_count":29,"resource_count":330},{"iso":"fra","population":24700,"name":"French","autonym":"français","bibles_count":46,"films_count":3,"resource_count":123},{"iso":"hye","population":235000,"name":"Armenian","autonym":"հայերէն/հայերեն","bibles_count":21,"films_count":3,"resource_count":5},{"iso":"hyw","population":290200,"name":"Western Armenian","autonym":"արեւմտահայերէն","bibles_count":2,"films_count":0,"resource_count":2},{"iso":"ita","population":6420,"name":"Italian","autonym":"italiano","bibles_count":16,"films_count":8,"resource_count":15},{"iso":"kmr","population":290200,"name":"Northern Kurdish - Kurmanji","autonym":"Northern Kurdish","bibles_count":8,"films_count":4,"resource_count":14},{"iso":"por","population":3410,"name":"Portuguese","autonym":"português","bibles_count":18,"films_count":7,"resource_count":342},{"iso":"rmt","population":5500,"name":"Domari","autonym":"دٛومَرِي","bibles_count":0,"films_count":1,"resource_count":2},{"iso":"spa","population":3260,"name":"Spanish","autonym":"Castilian","bibles_count":33,"films_count":11,"resource_count":124},{"iso":"tgl","population":20630,"name":"Tagalog","autonym":"ᜏᜒᜃᜅ᜔ ᜆᜄᜎᜓᜄ᜔","bibles_count":8,"films_count":14,"resource_count":18},{"iso":"tru","population":29060,"name":"Turoyo","autonym":"Sūrayṯ","bibles_count":1,"films_count":1,"resource_count":2},{"iso":"tur","population":87680,"name":"Turkish","autonym":"Türkçe","bibles_count":9,"films_count":35,"resource_count":316}],"country_maps":[{"continent_id":"","country_id":"LB","name":"Government","type":"gov","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/LB-gov.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/LB-gov.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"LB","name":"Land","type":"land","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/LB-land.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/LB-land.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"LB","name":"Location","type":"location","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/LB-location.png","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/LB-location.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"LB","name":"Transportation","type":"trans","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/LB-trans.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/LB-trans.jpg","url_pdf":""}]}
