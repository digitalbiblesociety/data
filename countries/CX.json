Following the Second World War Christmas Island came under the jurisdiction of the new British Colony of Singapore. The island existed as a separate Crown colony from 1 January 1958 to 1 October 1958 when its transfer to Australian jurisdiction was finalized. That date is still celebrated on the first Monday in October as Territory Day. Almost two-thirds of the island has been declared a national park.","overview":"Christmas Island is an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean lying south of Java Indonesia. A national park covers most of the 135-sq-km island offering rainforest hikes to wetlands and waterfalls like Hugh's Dale. Native wildlife includes nesting seabirds and the red crab a land species known for its late-fall migration to the sea.
