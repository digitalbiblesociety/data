Following the Second World War Christmas Island came under the jurisdiction of the new British Colony of Singapore. The island existed as a separate Crown colony from 1 January 1958 to 1 October 1958 when its transfer to Australian jurisdiction was finalized. That date is still celebrated on the first Monday in October as Territory Day. Almost two-thirds of the island has been declared a national park.","overview":"Christmas Island is an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean lying south of Java Indonesia. A national park covers most of the 135-sq-km island offering rainforest hikes to wetlands and waterfalls like Hugh's Dale. Native wildlife includes nesting seabirds and the red crab a land species known for its late-fall migration to the sea. The island is ringed with snorkelling and diving reefs.","independent":0,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":null,"land_mass_km":null,"population_christian":null,"population_christian_percentage":null,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":null,"population_migration":null,"population_year_change":null,"population_density_km":null,"population_average_age":null,"population_urban_percentage":null,"population_literacy_percentage":null,"landmass":null,"region_code":null,"region_id":"53","region_name":"Australia and New Zealand","languages":[{"iso":"coa","glotto_id":"coco1260","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Cocos Islands Malay","autonym":"Basa Pulu Cocos/Basa Pulu Keling","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Australia","area":"Tawau and Lahad Datu; 1 village northwest of Beluran.
