Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule. Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in April 2007 as Mauritania's first freely and fairly elected president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and installed a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected president in July 2009 and sworn in the following month. AZIZ sustained injuries from an accidental shooting by his own troops in October 2012 but has continued to maintain his authority. He was reelected in 2014 to a second and final term as president (according to the present constitution). The country continues to experience ethnic tensions among three major groups: Arabic-speaking descendants of slaves (Haratines) Arabic-speaking \\\"White Moors\\\" (Bidhan) and members of Sub-Saharan ethnic groups mostly originating in the Senegal River valley (Halpulaar Soninke and Wolof). Mauritania confronts a terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb which launched successful attacks between 2005 and 2010.","overview":"Mauritania officially the Islamic Republic of Mauritania is a country in the Maghreb region of Northwestern Africa.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":14,"land_mass_km":1030700,"population_christian":5000,"population_christian_percentage":0.14,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":84909,"population_migration":5000,"population_year_change":2.74,"population_density_km":5,"population_average_age":20,"population_urban_percentage":57,"population_literacy_percentage":"52.00","landmass":null,"region_code":8,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","languages":[{"iso":"bam","glotto_id":"bamb1269","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"bm","name":"Bambara","autonym":"ߓߡߊߣߊ߲ߞߊ߲","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Côte d&#039;Ivoire","area":"Also in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Guinea, Mauritania, Senegal.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"ML","latitude":"12.040080","longitude":"-9.989490","population":4183000,"status_id":"4","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"dyo","glotto_id":"jola1263","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Jola-Fonyi","autonym":"kujóolay","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Senegal and The Gambia","area":"Casamance River south, strip just north of Senegal-Gambia border north, west by Diouloulou-Marigot tributary, east by Soungrougrou River, Bignona area; east and southeast of Ziguinchor.
