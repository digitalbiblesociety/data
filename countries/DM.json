France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763 which colonized the island in 1805. In 1980 two years after independence Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES the first female prime minister in the Caribbean who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.","overview":"Dominica is a mountainous Caribbean island nation with natural hot springs and tropical rainforests. Morne Trois Pitons National Park is home to the volcanically heated steam-covered Boiling Lake. The park also encompasses sulphur vents the 65m-tall Trafalgar Falls and narrow Titou Gorge. To the west is Dominica’s capital Roseau with colorful timber houses and botanic gardens.","independent":1,"population_literacy_percentage":94,"region_id":419,"region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Dominica","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/DMA","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Caribbean/Dominica","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/dominica","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/DM","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/dominica.html","country_languages":[{"iso":"acf","population":60000,"name":"Saint Lucian Creole French","autonym":"kwéyòl","bibles_count":1,"films_count":0,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"aig","population":200,"name":"Antigua and Barbuda Creole English","autonym":"Antiguan Creole","bibles_count":1,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"eng","population":6000,"name":"English","autonym":"","bibles_count":243,"films_count":29,"resource_count":330},{"iso":"hat","population":7210,"name":"Haitian","autonym":"kreyòl ayisyen","bibles_count":3,"films_count":4,"resource_count":16},{"iso":"hin","population":510,"name":"Hindi","autonym":"हिंदी ","bibles_count":13,"films_count":34,"resource_count":71},{"iso":"jpn","population":890,"name":"Japanese","autonym":"日本語","bibles_count":13,"films_count":5,"resource_count":7}],"country_maps":[{"continent_id":"","country_id":"DM","name":"Government","type":"gov","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/DM-gov.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/DM-gov.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"DM","name":"Land","type":"land","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/DM-land.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/DM-land.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"DM","name":"Location","type":"location","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/DM-location.png","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/DM-location.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"DM","name":"Transportation","type":"trans","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/DM-trans.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/DM-trans.jpg","url_pdf":""}]}
