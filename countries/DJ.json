Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among the Afar minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in 2001 with a peace accord between Afar rebels and the Somali Issa-dominated government. In 1999 Djibouti's first multiparty presidential election resulted in the election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH as president; he was reelected to a second term in 2005 and extended his tenure in office via a constitutional amendment which allowed him to serve a third term in 2011 and begin a fourth term in 2016. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the intersection of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden and serves as an important shipping portal for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands and transshipments between Europe the Middle East and Asia. The government holds longstanding ties to France which maintains a significant military presence in the country and has strong ties with the US. Djibouti hosts several thousand members of US armed services at US-run Camp Lemonnier.","overview":"'Djibouti on the Horn of Africa is a mostly French- and Arabic-speaking country of dry shrublands volcanic formations and Gulf of Aden beaches.
