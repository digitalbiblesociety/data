The eastern four island groups adopted a constitution in 1979 and chose to become the Federated States of Micronesia. (The westernmost island group became Palau.) Independence came in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the US which was amended and renewed in 2004. Present concerns include large-scale unemployment overfishing overdependence on US foreign aid and state perception of inequitable allocation of US aid.","overview":"The Federated States of Micronesia is a country spread across the western Pacific Ocean comprising more than 600 islands. Micronesia is made up of 4 island states: Pohnpei Kosrae Chuuk and Yap. The country is known for palm-shaded beaches wreck-filled dives and ancient ruins including Nan Madol sunken basalt temples and burial vaults that extend out of a lagoon on Pohnpei.","independent":1,"population_refugee":4,"population_literacy_percentage":89,"region_id":57,"region_name":"Micronesia","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Micronesia-republic-Pacific-Ocean","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/FSM","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Oceania/Micronesia%2C_Federated_States_of","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/micronesia-federated-states-of","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/FM","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/micronesia.html","country_languages":[{"iso":"cal","population":2970,"name":"Carolinian","autonym":"Refaluwasch","bibles_count":1,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"cha","population":950,"name":"Chamorro","autonym":"Finu' Chamoru","bibles_count":2,"films_count":1,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"chk","population":48500,"name":"Chuukese","autonym":"Trukese","bibles_count":3,"films_count":1,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"cmn","population":550,"name":"Mandarin Chinese","autonym":"官话; 官話; Guānhuà","bibles_count":46,"films_count":22,"resource_count":82},{"iso":"eng","population":3100,"name":"English","autonym":"","bibles_count":243,"films_count":29,"resource_count":330},{"iso":"jpn","population":760,"name":"Japanese","autonym":"日本語","bibles_count":13,"films_count":5,"resource_count":7},{"iso":"kos","population":6540,"name":"Kosraean","autonym":"Kosrae","bibles_count":2,"films_count":0,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"kpg","population":2670,"name":"Kapingamarangi","autonym":"Kirinit","bibles_count":2,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"mkj","population":820,"name":"Mokilese","autonym":"Mwoakilloa","bibles_count":1,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"mrl","population":5990,"name":"Mortlockese","autonym":" Kapsen Mwoshulók","bibles_count":1,"films_count":0,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"ngm","population":500,"name":"Ngatik Men's Creole","autonym":"Ngatikese","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"nkr","population":790,"name":"Nukuoro","autonym":"Nukuoro","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"nmt","population":950,"name":"Namonuito","autonym":"Namon Weite","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"nuw","population":50,"name":"Nguluwan","autonym":"","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"pfa","population":1340,"name":"Pááfang","autonym":"","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"pif","population":2150,"name":"Pingelapese","autonym":"Pingelap","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"pon","population":0,"name":"Pohnpeian","autonym":"Mahsen en Pohnpei / Lokaiahn Pohnpei","bibles_count":3,"films_count":1,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"puw","population":1380,"name":"Puluwatese","autonym":"Puluwat","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"sov","population":760,"name":"Sonsorol","autonym":"Ramari Dongosaro","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"stw","population":480,"name":"Satawalese","autonym":"","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"tgl","population":850,"name":"Tagalog","autonym":"ᜏᜒᜃᜅ᜔ ᜆᜄᜎᜓᜄ᜔","bibles_count":8,"films_count":14,"resource_count":18},{"iso":"uli","population":3180,"name":"Ulithian","autonym":"Yulidiy","bibles_count":1,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"woe","population":1730,"name":"Woleaian","autonym":"","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"yap","population":6990,"name":"Yapese","autonym":"","bibles_count":1,"films_count":1,"resource_count":1}],"country_maps":[{"continent_id":"","country_id":"FM","name":"Government","type":"gov","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/FM-gov.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/FM-gov.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"FM","name":"Land","type":"land","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/FM-land.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/FM-land.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"FM","name":"Location","type":"location","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/FM-location.png","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/FM-location.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"FM","name":"Transportation","type":"trans","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/FM-trans.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/FM-trans.jpg","url_pdf":""}]}
