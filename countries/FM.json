The eastern four island groups adopted a constitution in 1979 and chose to become the Federated States of Micronesia. (The westernmost island group became Palau.) Independence came in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the US which was amended and renewed in 2004. Present concerns include large-scale unemployment overfishing overdependence on US foreign aid and state perception of inequitable allocation of US aid.","overview":"The Federated States of Micronesia is a country spread across the western Pacific Ocean comprising more than 600 islands. Micronesia is made up of 4 island states: Pohnpei Kosrae Chuuk and Yap. The country is known for palm-shaded beaches wreck-filled dives and ancient ruins including Nan Madol sunken basalt temples and burial vaults that extend out of a lagoon on Pohnpei.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":25,"land_mass_km":700,"population_christian":106000,"population_christian_percentage":95.4,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":4,"population_migration":-600,"population_year_change":1.06,"population_density_km":164,"population_average_age":24,"population_urban_percentage":21,"population_literacy_percentage":"89.00","landmass":null,"region_code":1,"region_id":"57","region_name":"Micronesia","languages":[{"iso":"cal","glotto_id":"caro1242","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Carolinian","autonym":"Refaluwasch","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Guam and Northern Mariana Islands","area":"Saipan, Anatahan, and Agrihan islands, Carolines.
