Self-governing since 1620 Bermuda is the oldest and most populous of the British overseas territories. Vacationing to the island to escape North American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism continues to be important to the island's economy although international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has also developed into a highly successful offshore financial center. A referendum on independence from the UK was soundly defeated in 1995.","overview":"Bermuda is a British island territory in the North Atlantic Ocean known for its pink-sand beaches such as Elbow Beach and Horseshoe Bay. Its massive Royal Naval Dockyard complex combines modern attractions like the interactive Dolphin Quest with maritime history at the National Museum of Bermuda. The island has a distinctive blend of British and American culture which can be found in the capital Hamilton.","independent":0,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":3,"land_mass_km":50,"population_christian":44000,"population_christian_percentage":64.7,"population_catholic_percentage":15,"population_protestant_percentage":50,"population_refugee":null,"population_migration":null,"population_year_change":-0.36,"population_density_km":1246,"population_average_age":null,"population_urban_percentage":97,"population_literacy_percentage":"98.00","landmass":null,"region_code":12,"region_id":"21","region_name":"Northern America","languages":[{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"por","glotto_id":"port1283","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"pt","name":"Portuguese","autonym":"português","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Portugal and Spain","area":"Iberia, Azores, Madeira.
