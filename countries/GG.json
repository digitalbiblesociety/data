    "introduction": "Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy which held sway in both France and England. The islands were the only British soil occupied by German troops in World War II. Guernsey is a British crown dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union. However the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its defense and international representation.",
    "overview": "Guernsey is one of the Channel Islands in the English Channel near the French coast and is a self-governing British Crown dependency. It's known for beach resorts like Cobo Bay and the scenery of its coastal cliffs. Castle Cornet a 13th-century harbor fortification in the capital of St. Peter Port now contains history and military museums. Hauteville House is the lavish former home of French writer Victor Hugo.",
