In 1980 a military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market economy and multiparty system VIEIRA's regime was characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In February 2000 a transitional government turned over power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in transparent polling. In September 2003 after only three years in office YALA was overthrown in a bloodless military coup and businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In 2005 former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an emergency election held in June 2009 but he passed away in January 2012 from an existing illness. A military coup in April 2012 prevented Guinea-Bissau's second-round presidential election - to determine SANHA's successor - from taking place.","overview":"Guinea-Bissau is a tropical country on West Africa’s Atlantic coast that’s known for national parks and wildlife. The forested sparsely populated Bijagós archipelago is a protected biosphere reserve. Its main island Bubaque forms part of the Orango Islands National Park a habitat for saltwater hippos. On the mainland the capital Bissau is a port with Portuguese colonial buildings in its old city center.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":35,"land_mass_km":28120,"population_christian":165000,"population_christian_percentage":10,"population_catholic_percentage":10,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":1852,"population_migration":-1399,"population_year_change":2.45,"population_density_km":70,"population_average_age":19,"population_urban_percentage":45,"population_literacy_percentage":"55.00","landmass":null,"region_code":8,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","languages":[{"iso":"apc","glotto_id":"nort3139","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"North Levantine Arabic","autonym":"اللهجة الشامي الشمال","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Jordan and Syria","area":"Also in Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Belize, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Egypt, French Guiana, Israel, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mali, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey (Asia).","progress":"Portions\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"SY","latitude":"34.170933","longitude":"36.046843","population":24600000,"status_id":"3","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"bab","glotto_id":"bain1259","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Bainouk-Gunyuño","autonym":" Nyun","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"South of Casamance River.","progress":"\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GW","latitude":"12.312770","longitude":"-16.058580","population":8860,"status_id":"6a","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"bam","glotto_id":"bamb1269","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"bm","name":"Bambara","autonym":"ߓߡߊߣߊ߲ߞߊ߲","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Côte d&#039;Ivoire","area":"Also in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Guinea, Mauritania, Senegal.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"ML","latitude":"12.040080","longitude":"-9.989490","population":4183000,"status_id":"4","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"bda","glotto_id":"bayo1255","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Bayot","autonym":"Baiot","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Guinea and Guinea-Bissau","area":"Southwest of Ziguinchor, a cluster of villages grouped around Nyassia village.
