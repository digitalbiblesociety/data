Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987 Macau became the Macau Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on 20 December 1999. In this agreement China promised that under its \\\"one country two systems\\\" formula China's political and economic system would not be imposed on Macau and that Macau would enjoy a \\\"high degree of autonomy\\\" in all matters except foreign affairs and defense for the subsequent 50 years.","overview":"Macau is an autonomous region on the south coast of China across the Pearl River Delta from Hong Kong. A Portuguese territory until 1999 it reflects a mix of cultural influences. Its giant casinos and malls on the Cotai Strip which joins the islands of Taipa and Coloane have earned it the nickname \"Las Vegas of Asia.\" One of its more striking landmarks is 338m-high Macau Tower with sweeping city views.","independent":0,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":11,"land_mass_km":30,"population_christian":null,"population_christian_percentage":null,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":1,"population_migration":5000,"population_year_change":1.39,"population_density_km":21645,"population_average_age":39,"population_urban_percentage":null,"population_literacy_percentage":"97.00","landmass":null,"region_code":3,"region_id":"30","region_name":"Eastern Asia","languages":[{"iso":"cmn","glotto_id":"mand1415","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Mandarin Chinese","autonym":"官话; 官話; Guānhuà","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"China","area":"Widespread north of Changjiang River, a belt south of the Changjiang from Qiujiang (Jiangxi) to Zhenjiang (Jiangsu), Hubei, except southeast corner, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, northwest part of Guangxi, and northwest corner of Hunan.
