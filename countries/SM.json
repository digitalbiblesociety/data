According to tradition it was founded by a Christian stonemason named MARINUS in A.D. 301. San Marino's foreign policy is aligned with that of the EU although it is not a member; social and political trends in the republic track closely with those of its larger neighbor Italy.","overview":"San Marino is a mountainous microstate surrounded by north-central Italy. Among the world’s oldest republics it retains much of its historic architecture. On the slopes of Monte Titano sits the capital also called San Marino known for its medieval walled old town and narrow cobblestone streets. The Three Towers castlelike citadels dating to the 11th century sit atop Titano’s neighboring peaks.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":2,"land_mass_km":60,"population_christian":31000,"population_christian_percentage":91.6,"population_catholic_percentage":90.5,"population_protestant_percentage":1.1,"population_refugee":null,"population_migration":null,"population_year_change":0.21,"population_density_km":566,"population_average_age":null,"population_urban_percentage":97,"population_literacy_percentage":"96.00","landmass":null,"region_code":10,"region_id":"39","region_name":"Southern Europe","languages":[{"iso":"ita","glotto_id":"ital1282","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"it","name":"Italian","autonym":"italiano","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Liechtenstein and Switzerland","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Egypt, Eritrea, France, Germany, Israel, Libya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Paraguay, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Romania, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vatican State.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"IT","latitude":"43.046411","longitude":"12.648925","population":55000000,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}]}
