According to tradition it was founded by a Christian stonemason named MARINUS in A.D. 301. San Marino's foreign policy is aligned with that of the EU although it is not a member; social and political trends in the republic track closely with those of its larger neighbor Italy.","overview":"San Marino is a mountainous microstate surrounded by north-central Italy. Among the world’s oldest republics it retains much of its historic architecture.
