More than 200000 Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that integrated defense forces and established a new constitution and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The government of President Pierre NKURUNZIZA who was reelected in 2010 and again in a disputed election in 2015 continues to face many political and economic challenges.","overview":"Burundi officially the Republic of Burundi is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of East Africa bordered by Rwanda to the north Tanzania to the east and south and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":8,"land_mass_km":25680,"population_christian":7662000,"population_christian_percentage":75,"population_catholic_percentage":60,"population_protestant_percentage":15,"population_refugee":78473,"population_migration":2001,"population_year_change":3.12,"population_density_km":463,"population_average_age":17,"population_urban_percentage":14,"population_literacy_percentage":"85.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","languages":[{"iso":"apc","glotto_id":"nort3139","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"North Levantine Arabic","autonym":"اللهجة الشامي الشمال","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Jordan and Syria","area":"Also in Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Belize, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Egypt, French Guiana, Israel, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mali, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey (Asia).","progress":"Portions\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"SY","latitude":"34.170933","longitude":"36.046843","population":24600000,"status_id":"3","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"ell","glotto_id":"mode1248","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"el","name":"Modern Greek (1453-)","autonym":"Νέα Ελληνικά","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cyprus","area":"Widespread, especially in Greek Macedonia.
