Germany annexed the island in 1888. A German-British consortium began mining the island's phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent republic.","overview":"'Nauru is a tiny island country in Micronesia northeast of Australia. It features a coral reef and white-sand beaches fringed with palms including Anibare Bay on the east coast. Inland tropical vegetation surrounds Buada Lagoon. The rocky outcrop of Command Ridge the island''s highest point has a rusty Japanese outpost from WWII. The underground freshwater lake of Moqua Well lies amid the limestone Moqua Caves.'","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":9,"land_mass_km":20,"population_christian":null,"population_christian_percentage":null,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":763,"population_migration":null,"population_year_change":0.63,"population_density_km":541,"population_average_age":null,"population_urban_percentage":null,"population_literacy_percentage":"97.00","landmass":null,"region_code":1,"region_id":"57","region_name":"Micronesia","languages":[{"iso":"cpi","glotto_id":"chin1253","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Chinese Pidgin English","autonym":"Melanesian-Chinese Mixed Pidgin English","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"No Scripture\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"NR","latitude":"-0.532240","longitude":"166.925530","population":0,"status_id":"6b","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"gil","glotto_id":"gilb1244","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Gilbertese","autonym":"Kiribati","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Solomon Islands","area":"Also in Fiji, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, United States, Vanuatu.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"KI","latitude":"0.640490","longitude":"173.219604","population":118620,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"kos","glotto_id":"kosr1238","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Kosraean","autonym":"Kosrae","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Federated States of Micronesia","area":"Kusaie Island, Caroline Islands.
