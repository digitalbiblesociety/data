Germany annexed the island in 1888. A German-British consortium began mining the island's phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent republic.","overview":"'Nauru is a tiny island country in Micronesia northeast of Australia. It features a coral reef and white-sand beaches fringed with palms including Anibare Bay on the east coast. Inland tropical vegetation surrounds Buada Lagoon. The rocky outcrop of Command Ridge the island''s highest point has a rusty Japanese outpost from WWII. The underground freshwater lake of Moqua Well lies amid the limestone Moqua Caves.'","independent":1,"population_refugee":763,"population_literacy_percentage":97,"region_id":57,"region_name":"Micronesia","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Nauru","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Oceania/Nauru","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/nauru","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/NR","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/nauru.html","country_languages":[{"iso":"cpi","population":100,"name":"Chinese Pidgin English","autonym":"Melanesian-Chinese Mixed Pidgin English","bibles_count":0,"films_count":0,"resource_count":0},{"iso":"eng","population":250,"name":"English","autonym":"","bibles_count":243,"films_count":29,"resource_count":330},{"iso":"gil","population":0,"name":"Gilbertese","autonym":"Kiribati","bibles_count":5,"films_count":1,"resource_count":7},{"iso":"kos","population":0,"name":"Kosraean","autonym":"Kosrae","bibles_count":2,"films_count":0,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"mah","population":0,"name":"Marshallese","autonym":"Ebon","bibles_count":5,"films_count":1,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"nau","population":8700,"name":"Nauru","autonym":"Nauru","bibles_count":1,"films_count":1,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"tvl","population":200,"name":"Tuvalu","autonym":"Te Ggana Tuuvalu","bibles_count":2,"films_count":0,"resource_count":1},{"iso":"yue","population":200,"name":"Yue Chinese","autonym":"Cantonese","bibles_count":12,"films_count":11,"resource_count":24}],"country_maps":[{"continent_id":"","country_id":"NR","name":"Government","type":"gov","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/NR-gov.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/NR-gov.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"NR","name":"Land","type":"land","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/NR-land.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/NR-land.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"NR","name":"Location","type":"location","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/NR-location.png","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/NR-location.jpg","url_pdf":""},{"continent_id":"","country_id":"NR","name":"Transportation","type":"trans","source":"World Fact Book","url":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/NR-trans.jpg","url_thumb":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/country/thumbs/NR-trans.jpg","url_pdf":""}]}
