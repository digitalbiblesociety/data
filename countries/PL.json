By the mid-16th century the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled a vast tract of land in Central and Eastern Europe. During the 18th century internal disorders weakened the nation and in a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 Russia Prussia and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following the war but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \\\"Solidarity\\\" that over time became a political force with over 10 million members. Free elections in 1989 and 1990 won Solidarity control of the parliament and the presidency bringing the communist era to a close. A \\\"shock therapy\\\" program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic market-oriented country largely completed and with large investments in defense energy and other infrastructure Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.","overview":"Poland is an eastern European country on the Baltic Sea known for its medieval architecture and Jewish heritage. Warsaw the capital has shopping and nightlife plus the Warsaw Uprising Museum honoring the city’s WWII-era resistance to German occupation. In the city of Kraków 14th-century Wawel Castle rises above the medieval old town home to Cloth Hall a Renaissance trading post in Rynek Glówny (market square).","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":37,"land_mass_km":306230,"population_christian":36090000,"population_christian_percentage":94.3,"population_catholic_percentage":86.3,"population_protestant_percentage":8,"population_refugee":12673,"population_migration":-29395,"population_year_change":-0.11,"population_density_km":124,"population_average_age":42,"population_urban_percentage":60,"population_literacy_percentage":"100.00","landmass":null,"region_code":9,"region_id":"151","region_name":"Eastern Europe","languages":[{"iso":"bel","glotto_id":"bela1254","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"be","name":"Belarusian","autonym":"беларуская мова biełaruskaja mova","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"Also in Azerbaijan, Canada, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Russian Federation (Europe), Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United States, Uzbekistan.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"BY","latitude":"53.230655","longitude":"25.603835","population":2637920,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"bul","glotto_id":"bulg1262","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"bg","name":"Bulgarian","autonym":"българскиbălgarski","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","area":"Also in Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Libya, Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey (Europe), Ukraine, United States.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"BG","latitude":"43.364585","longitude":"25.046987","population":6967000,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"ces","glotto_id":"czec1258","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"cs","name":"Czech","autonym":"čeština","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"West: Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia.
