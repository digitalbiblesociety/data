The islands' sugar industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India between 1845 and 1917 which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tourism mostly in Tobago is targeted for expansion and is growing. The government is coping with a rise in violent crime.","overview":"Trinidad and Tobago is a dual-island Caribbean nation near Venezuela with distinctive Creole traditions and cuisines. Trinidad’s capital Port of Spain hosts a boisterous carnival featuring calypso and soca music. Numerous bird species inhabit sanctuaries such as the Asa Wright Nature Centre. The smaller island of Tobago is known for its beaches and the Tobago Main Ridge Forest Reserve which shelters hummingbirds.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":13,"land_mass_km":5130,"population_christian":774000,"population_christian_percentage":57.6,"population_catholic_percentage":21.5,"population_protestant_percentage":33.4,"population_refugee":2321,"population_migration":-800,"population_year_change":0.32,"population_density_km":273,"population_average_age":36,"population_urban_percentage":52,"population_literacy_percentage":"99.00","landmass":null,"region_code":12,"region_id":"419","region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","languages":[{"iso":"acf","glotto_id":"sain1246","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Saint Lucian Creole French","autonym":"kwéyòl","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Creole Languages of the Eastern Caribbean","area":"Also in Dominica, France, Grenada, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago.","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"LC","latitude":"15.394660","longitude":"-61.364130","population":689000,"status_id":"5","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"apc","glotto_id":"nort3139","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"North Levantine Arabic","autonym":"اللهجة الشامي الشمال","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Jordan and Syria","area":"Also in Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Belize, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Egypt, French Guiana, Israel, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mali, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey (Asia).","progress":"Portions\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"SY","latitude":"34.170933","longitude":"36.046843","population":24600000,"status_id":"3","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"DE","latitude":"48.648954","longitude":"12.467623","population":76100000,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"fra","glotto_id":"stan1290","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"fr","name":"French","autonym":"français","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Andorra and France","area":"Also in Algeria, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, French Guiana, French Polynesia, Gabon, Guadeloupe, Guinea, Haiti, India, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mali, Martinique, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, Monaco, Morocco, Mozambique, New Caledonia, Niger, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Réunion, Rwanda, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"FR","latitude":"48.000000","longitude":"2.000000","population":77200000,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},{"iso":"hns","glotto_id":"cari1275","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Caribbean Hindustani","autonym":"Caribbean Hindi-Urdu","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"Coastal region.
