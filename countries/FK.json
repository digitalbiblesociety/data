The colony was turned over to Spain two years later and the islands have since been the subject of a territorial dispute first between Britain and Spain then between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and after fierce fighting forced an Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982. With hostilities ended and Argentine forces withdrawn UK administration resumed. In response to renewed calls from Argentina for Britain to relinquish control of the islands a referendum was held in March 2013 which resulted in 99.8% of the population voting to remain a part of the UK.","overview":"'The Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) are a remote South Atlantic archipelago.
