Bouvet Island was discovered in 1739 by a French naval officer after whom it is named. No claim was made until 1825 when the British flag was raised. In 1928 the UK waived its claim in favor of Norway which had occupied the island the previous year. In 1971 Norway designated Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters a nature reserve. Since 1977 Norway has run an automated meteorological station and studied foraging strategies and distribution of fur seals and penguins on the island. In February 2006 an earthquake weakened the station's foundation causing it to be blown out to sea in a winter storm. Norway erected a new research station in 2014 that can hold six people for periods of two to four months.","overview":"Bouvet Island is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at 54°25.8′S 3°22.8′E thus putting it north of and outside the Antarctic Treaty System.","independent":0,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":null,"land_mass_km":null,"population_christian":null,"population_christian_percentage":null,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":null,"population_migration":null,"population_year_change":null,"population_density_km":null,"population_average_age":null,"population_urban_percentage":null,"population_literacy_percentage":null,"landmass":null,"region_code":null,"region_id":"419","region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","languages":[]}
