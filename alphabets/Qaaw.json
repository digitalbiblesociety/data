It is not believed to be in current use, having been replaced by the Latin script.</p> <p>The script is written vertically, from top to bottom and from right to left. Books written in the script accordingly open on the left.</p> <p>There are three types of consonant symbol in Tai Yo. Twenty-four symbols are used only at the start of a syllable. Five symbols are used only at the end of a syllable. Three symbols can be used either at the start or at the end of a syllable, although their position in the syllable dictates their pronunciation. At the start they represent ɓ, ƌ, ɲ, but at the end they represent p, t, j.</p> <p>There is a tone mark for indicating tone.</p> <p>Consonants do not contain an inherent vowel; all vowels are written explicitly by means of dependent symbols. There are 15 vowel symbols in total, 5 of which represent diphthongs. Vowels can be joined after (that is, below) a consonant, or to the right of it.</p> <p>There are 5 (possibly 6) consonant+vowel ligatures, representing at, ak, am, an, ang, (ap).</p> <p>One symbol can represent either one of a number of vowels, or the labialization of a consonant. When written below the consonant it represents the dipthong ie or ia; when it is both written to the right of the consonant and is syllable-final it represents ăi; when it is both written to the right <span class=Em>and</span> is followed by a vowel it represents labialization. The exception to representing labialization with this symbol is k<sup>w</sup>, which is written with a separate symbol.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
