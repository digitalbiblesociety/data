There are three varieties of Bai, Jianchuan (Central), Dali (Southern), and Bijiang (Northern). It is not agreed upon whether these should be classified as dialects or as distinct languages. The ethnologue separates them into three distinct languages. A Bai script has been in use since around the 8th century, but this was never standardized. A Latin-based orthography has now largely replaced the traditional Lao Baiwen script. This is based on the Central Jianchuan Bai language, but also accommodates features of the other two Bai languages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=Em\u003eThis script is not currently recognized by \u003ca href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank\u003e\u003cimg src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png /\u003e\u0026nbsp;ISO 15924\u003c/a\u003e, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
