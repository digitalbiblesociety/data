The script is written from right to left using twenty-five consonant letters (including a ‘vowel-carrier’), four basic vowel signs, a vowel-length mark, a zero-vowel mark, and a gemination sign. Each consonant has an initial and a non-initial form.</p> <p>It is unknown whether the script is in use; the Wolof language is normally written with the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Latn>Latin</a> script. Charles Riley conducted a research trip to Senegal in 2009, during which time he met with Assane Faye and visited his home. He writes that Assane Faye “has been offering lessons in (the script) to hundreds of people over the years, translated the Koran using it, and has a house filled with dozens of unpublished handwritten texts.” (from <a href=http://www.indiana.edu/~libsalc/african/ALN125/125RoadTrip.html target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;My Francophone Road Trip</a> by Charles Riley.)</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
