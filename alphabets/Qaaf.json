The script is also used in China, where the Khmu population is relatively small and isolated. The language is also spoken in other parts of Laos, where it is written in the Laotian script, and in Vietnam, Myanmar and Thailand, where it is written in the Latin script. Speakers in Mengla, on the China/Laos border do not apply any script to the language. There have been experimental attempts in Thailand to apply the Thai script to Khmu phonology.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
