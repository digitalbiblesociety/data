It is thought to have derived from the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Phnx>Phoenician</a> abjad.</p> <p>The Numidian script resembles the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Tfng>Tifinagh</a> script currently employed by the Tuareg, the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior. However, Tifinagh is written horizontally and Numidian was normally written from bottom to top, in columns from left to right. In some bilingual Numidian and Phoenician inscriptions, the Numidian parts were written from right to left horizontally in the Phoenician manner.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
