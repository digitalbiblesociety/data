The script is derived from Brahmi, and shows close similarities to the Grantha script which was used in southern India until the 16th century. Sinhala is a diglossic language, that is, the spoken and written forms of the language show considerable variation. The main differences are that retroflex ɭ and ɳ are represented in writing but have assimilated to alveolar l and n in speech, that three vowel sounds ə, a and ā are represented by only two letters, the pronunciation of which is generally predictable from a set of contextual rules, and that there are two letters transcribed ṣ and ś but both pronounced ʃ. Additionally, spelling conventions do not always reflect current pronunciation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are two forms of the Sinhala script. The standard, pure, form which is taught in schools is called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eeḷu hōḍiya\u003c/span\u003e or \u003cspan class=Em\u003eśuddha hōḍiya\u003c/span\u003e. This system contains twenty consonant and twenty vowel letters and can be used to represent the sounds of the spoken language almost perfectly. However, to adhere to current spelling conventions - some of which represent archaic pronunciations - and to accurately transcribe Sanskrit, Pali, Hindi and English loanwords, a wider set of letters is needed. This set is called mixed alphabet \u003cspan class=Em\u003emiśra hōḍiya\u003c/span\u003e and contains an additional eighteen consonant letters, many of which are aspirated equivalents of existing letters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Sinhala script is an abugida. Each letter represents a consonant+vowel syllable, with the vowel a being inherent in each syllable. This vowel can be changed by means of diacritics written above, below, to the left or to the right of the base consonant, or in a combination of positions. Examples of vowel diacritics with the consonant \u003cspan class=Em\u003em\u003c/span\u003e are shown below:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/yr/rj/yrrj4bqfur_SinhaV.png height=69 width=247 /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are two additional diacritic marks, both called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehal kirīma\u003c/span\u003e which can be written above a consonant letter to silence the vowel altogether. The selection of one \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehal kirīma\u003c/span\u003e over the other is determined by the shape of the consonant letter. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehal kirīma\u003c/span\u003e with \u003cspan class=Em\u003ep\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003eb\u003c/span\u003e respectively is shown in red below:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/yr/rj/yrrj4bqfur_SinhalaHal.png.jpg height=32 width=50 /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVowels which occur at the start of a word, so not preceded by a consonant, are written with independent vowel letters. Unusually for Indian languages, Sinhala has distinct signs (short and long) for the low front vowel æ.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpoken Sinhala is different from most Indian languages in that it uses a set of prenasalized stops which are distinct from nasal+stop combinations, and are represented differently in writing. So there is a single letter for representing the prenasalized sound ɳɖ in the word aɳɖa sound, but in the word aɳɖa egg, the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eɳ\u003c/span\u003e and the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eɖ\u003c/span\u003e are written using two separate letters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are some conjunct letters for writing consonant clusters, including \u003ca href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?\u0026cat_id=Glossary#gemination target=_blank\u003e\u003cimg src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png /\u003e\u0026nbsp;geminates\u003c/a\u003e (long consonants). Generally, these are formed by attaching a full form of the second letter to a truncated form of the first. Some conjuncts are used which are not so easily decomposable into their parts. Special conjunct symbols also exist for combining \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e either before or after another consonant, and for combining \u003cspan class=Em\u003ey\u003c/span\u003e after a consonant. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehal kirīma\u003c/span\u003e sign can also be used to write two consecutive consonants with no intermediate vowel.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA set of Sinhala digits existed, representing numbers 0-9, multiples of 10 up to 100, and the number 1000. However, these are no longer used, having been replaced by Latin digits. The old Sinhala punctuation mark \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekunddaliya\u003c/span\u003e, which was previously used as a full stop, has also been supplanted by the Latin punctuation set. \u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["pli","san","sin"]}
