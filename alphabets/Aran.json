It has short verticals and long horizontal strokes. Due to the slope and calligraphic style, placement of nuqtas (dots) on the base characters is forced to vary quite a bit among different letters and even different forms of the same letter. Words are separated by a space. </p> <p>The name (Nastaliq) is a composite of the names for the \\\\\\Naskh\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Taliq\\\\\\\" styles of writing. Nastaliq is used in Afghanistan","fonts":[]}
