Prior to the creation of this script, the Fulani language was written in the Latin and Arabic scripts. In the 1980s, two teenage brothers, Ibrahima and Abdoulaye Barry, wondered why their language did not have its own script and set about creating one. They named their script ‘Adlam’ because the first four characters in the repertoire represent A, D, L, and M.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFollowing the creation of the script, the two brothers initially produced hand-written textbooks to aid in its dissemination. They first taught their other family members to read and write, then the women and children in their village. Along with the script, the books taught lessons in water hygiene and basic medical care. Gradually, the script grew in popularity and the brothers set up learning centres in Togo, Senegal, Benin, and even amongst Fulani speakers in New York. Eventually, the means were available to print the script, and a newspaper and a number of printed books were published. However, the rapid growth of Adlam attracted the attention of the Guinean government, who were opposed to the new script which they could not read, and Ibrahim was imprisoned for three months. After his release, in 2007, he moved to America and took a job with a software company.

It is the only known indigenous script for a creole language. The script was named for its inventor, a Nenge man called Afaka Atumisi. It is now believed to have fallen into disuse.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSyllable structure in the Nenge language allows for initial consonant clusters containing a nasal and a stop, and for doubly articulated consonants (two consonants produced simultaneously at different places in the oral cavity). Vowels can also be complex or nasalized. If each of these is considered to be a single sound, as is the case for speakers of the language, syllables can be analyzed as exclusively consisting of a consonant + vowel. In the Afaka script, single letters were used to represent these complex consonant + vowel combinations. However, this resulted in many contrasts in the language being unrepresented in writing. The same letters were used to write bo bow and bṍ bone, for example. Syllables starting with the sounds b, d, dj,f, g, l, m, n, s, and j were written with the same letter regardless of the following vowel. The vowels i and e were not represented when following the consonants l, m, s, and w. Tone is also contrastive in the language, but was not written. na is and ná is not vary only in tone, so were written the same. Given the predictable subject matter for which the script was generally used - most texts repeated many fixed religious expressions - this underrepresentation did not necessarily hamper understanding when reading. However, it became more problematic when users needed to express novel or less predictable expressions, which the deficiencies in the script left ambiguous.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne punctuation mark was used, a vertical line which marks the end of a clause or a sentence, roughly equivalent to a comma and a full stop. Inter-word spacing was used, but not by everyone.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAfakas script came to the attention of the wider world in 1915, when Brother Bernard, a Catholic missionary in Suriname, observed a man reading a book full of unknown symbols. The man was Afakas brother-in-law Abena, one of about 30 people to whom Afaka had taught the script. Abena asked Br. Bernard to dictate a number of liturgical Catholic prayers in Nenge, which he then recorded in the script. Much of what is known about the script is attributed to Br. Bernards colleague, Father Morssink, who went to considerable lengths to study and propagate the script, with limited success.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe limited success of the script is believed to have been largely due to its underrepresentation of many phonological contrasts. It was likely due in part to its associations with European missionaries; some Nenge speakers saw it as a means to convert them to a European faith. In addition, literacy had never been a part of the Nenge society, and many saw no reason to change their traditional way of life, especially at a perceived cost to their spiritual welfare. A more controversial view is that the symbols already existed prior to the creation of the script, but that they had religious, rather than phonetic, significance. Many of them resemble acrophonic rebuses - stylized pictures of something which begins with the sound the symbol stands for - from Africa, where they may have been used in religious ceremonies. Some Nenge may have felt that using the sacred symbols for mundane or secular purposes would be irreverent.\u003c/p\u003e","diacritics":false,"direction":"ltr","direction_notes":"","family":"American","ligatures":"unspecified","name":"Afaka","numeral_systems":null,"open_type_tag":"none","reordering":false,"requires_font":false,"sample":"","sample_img":"","script":"Afak","split_graphs":false,"status":"Current","type":"syllabary","unicode":true,"unicode_pdf":"","whitespace":"discretionary"},{"alphabet_languages":null,"baseline":"unspecified","bibles":null,"case":false,"complex_positioning":"unknown","contextual_forms":false,"description":"\u003cp\u003eThe Caucasian Albanian script was used to write the language of Caucasian Albania (which is not the same as present-day European Albania).

The Ahom people descended from the Shan ethnic group of Myanmar but migrated to what is now Assam, India, in the 13th century, taking their language, script and cultural traditions with them. There they established the Ahom Kingdom, where Ahom was the official language until the absorption of the region by the British Empire in 1826. After this, the Assamese language and script were promoted and have now almost entirely replaced Ahom.

Since the words of the Prophet Muhammed can only be written in Arabic, the Arabic script has traveled far and wide with the spread of Islam and came to be used for a number of languages throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Many of these are non-Semitic languages, so employ very different sound systems from spoken Arabic, and as a result the script has had to be adapted and is used slightly differently by speakers of different languages. Many African languages use an Arabic-based transcription system called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eAjami\u003c/span\u003e, which is different from the original Arabic script.

Conventionally, for writing the Arabic language, long vowels are written and short vowels are omitted.

Aramaic writing is derived from the Phoenician script. Because the evolution from one to the other was a continuous process over about 2000 years it is difficult to divide it neatly into uniquely Phoenician and uniquely Aramaic blocks; however, it is generally agreed that a divergence into two distinct scripts was evident by about the 8th century BC. Both the Phoenician and Aramaic scripts were the antecedents of a large and geographically diverse family of writing systems. Many of the scripts used today for writing Indo-European languages are part of this family. Again, because the two scripts were so closely related it is not clear exactly which writings systems descended from each.

Imperial Aramaic writing was so influential that it survived the collapse of the Persian Empire which had initially disseminated it, and continued to be used until the 2nd century AD. By the end of the 3rd century, variant forms of the script had diverged into distinct scripts such as Syriac, Nabataean and Palmyran. The form of Imperial Aramaic which changed the least is now used for writing the Hebrew language.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eImperial Aramaic was written from right to left, with or without spaces between words. The script was an abjad; each of the twenty-two letters represented a consonant. Because the interpretation of some words was ambiguous when the vowels were not written, Aramaic scribes began using a select few of the existing consonantal letters to indicate long vowels, first at the end of words, then inside words. Letters having this dual consonant/vowel function are (called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ematres lectionis\u003c/span\u003e).

The Geez script has also been suggested as a possible influence. Armenia adopted Christianity in the early fourth century, but later began reverting to paganism. Mashtots believed that if the Bible could be written in Armenian the country would have the means to maintain a Christian faith and culture at a time when the Persian empire was attempting to assimilate the country.

There is no upper- or lower-case. There are thirty-five consonant letters and eleven independent vowel letters, two of which represent the diphthongs oj and ow. Each vowel letter also has a diacritic form which combines with a consonant to modify the inherent vowel. These can be written to the left or the right of, or above or below the consonant.

In general, it is pronounced ɔ except when followed by i, j, u or w, in which contexts it is pronounted o. However this is not always predictable. In addition, at the end of a syllable (at the end of or within a word), the vowel is often not pronounced even when this is not indicated with \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehasanta\u003c/span\u003e.

Often these involve little or no change in letterform, but in some cases one letter changes unrecognizably from its isolated form and in a few cases both letters do so. Conjuncts are written with the parts alongside each other or in stacks. Pronunciation of conjuncts is not always what would be expected from the sum of their parts, due to sound changes in spoken Bengali which are not represented in writing. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003ej\u003c/span\u003e+\u003cspan class=Em\u003eñ\u003c/span\u003e conjunct is pronounced g+nasalization at the start of a word or gg elsewhere, for example \u003cspan class=Em\u003ebijña\u003c/span\u003e, pronounced biggo/õ wise. Combinations of C+\u003cspan class=Em\u003em\u003c/span\u003e are pronounced at the start of a word as C+nasalization, or as CC elsewhere. The conjunct \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekʃa\u003c/span\u003e represents khɔ at the start of a word and khhɔ within a word, as in the case of the womans name written \u003cspan class=Em\u003elakʃmi\u003c/span\u003e but pronounced lokkhi.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/j6/sp/j6spskdfbr_BengaliConjuncts.png height=170 width=360 /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome other spelling conventions also reflect archaic pronunciation.

The name Brahmi actually does not refer to a single, discrete script as such; general practise is to use the term to refer to any script in the family now known as Brahmic, up until approximately 400 AD, at which point they became differentiated enough to be given their own names. Brahmic writing was originally used for writing early dialects of the Prakrit language, but spread widely during the period of Indian cultural expansion in the 1st millenium AD and has since provided the underlying design for over sixty scripts used by languages from the Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman language families.

One of these was Kharoshthi; the other was Brahmi. The origins of Brahmi are not known for certain, but it is thought to have been influenced by the Imperial Aramaic script.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBrahmi writing has been attested primarily in inscriptions on graves and buildings, most famously the edicts made by Emperor Ashoka around 200 BC.

The script was an abugida; there were thirty-three consonant letters each representing a CV syllable containing the inherent vowel a. Other post-consonantal vowels were written using one of nine vowel diacritics (together with the inherent vowel, five pairs of long and short vowels could be represented) around the consonant letter. There were also nine letters for writing vowels which were not preceded by a consonant. Special conjunct letters existed for writing consonant clusters.

The script is believed by many to have derived from the epigraphic South Arabian script, of Proto-Sinaitic heritage, although there is some dispute surrounding this assertion; some also believe it to have descended from Egyptian hieroglyphics. According to the tradition of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the script was divinely revealed to Enos, grandson of the first man, Adam. Unlike other Semitic scripts, Ethiopic is written from left to right.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe original Geez script was an abjad - vowels were not written - but the current script is classified as an abugida. Each symbol represents a CV syllable, but vowels are not inherent in the consonant. The original Ethiopic script contained 182 characters, although the basic (unmarked) consonants number only 26. The script has since been extended for other languages and now contains over 500 symbols. Some of the new symbols represent phonological processes such as palatalization, pharyngealization and labialization.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe unmarked set is known as the first order (also called the first form). Each of the first order consonants can be combined with one of six vowels, to produce a syllograph. The resulting sets of syllographs are known as the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh orders. In some languages there is an additional vowel symbol which can be combined with the first order consonants to produce an eighth order.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/zf/fl/zffllj5kg6_Ethioforms.png height=238 width=397 /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs shown in the chart, the way in which consonant characters are combined with vowel signs often follows a general pattern, particularly in the second to sixth orders, but it is by no means fully systematic. This has sometimes resulted in the creation of a new character, unrelated in form to the unmarked consonant. For this reason, in tables of Ethiopic letters, all 182 characters tend to be displayed, unlike tables of Brahmic abugidas which combine consonants and vowels in a predictable manner. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script does not completely represent some languages.

A manuscript form called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eNushkuri\u003c/span\u003e was derived from this alphabet for use in handwritten texts around the 9th century. From the 10th century, the two forms came to be used together as upper- and lower case pairs of a single writing system.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eInitially, some manuscripts were written in Asomtavruli, some in Nuskhuri, and some in a free mixture of the two. Over time, it became increasingly common to combine the two scripts into the bicameral (that is, having upper and lower case) system called Khutsuri. Asomtavruli had no ascenders or descenders so lent itself to the upper case set, while Nushkuri was used for the lower case. In bicameral Khutsuri texts, Asomtavruli capitals were always found at the start of paragraphs but were optional at the start of sentences within a paragraph.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKhutsuri is now only used as a liturgical script by the Georgian Orthodox Church, having been replaced elsewhere by the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eMkhedruli\u003c/span\u003e alphabet.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are 36 letters in both Asomtavruli and Nushkuri (therefore a total of 72 symbols in Khutsuri), representing 6 vowels and 30 consonants.

Since the 11th century, a third script has been attested, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eMkhedruli\u003c/span\u003e. There is some debate as to the origins of this third script; some scholars say that it evolved from the Khutsuri system, other, that it pre-dates it. What is generally agreed upon is that Mkhedruli was used as a secular script alongside the ecclesiastical Khutsuri until the 18th century, since which time it has been used for nearly all Georgian writing. The three scripts share the same letter names, despite having different letter shapes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Mkhedruli alphabet is also used for writing the Mingrelian and Svan languages spoken in Georgia, as well as Laz, spoken in Turkey.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are 33 Mkhedruli letters currently used for writing Georgian, plus another 8 which are now obsolete. There is an almost exact one-to-one mapping between sounds and letters, that is, every sound is written and (almost) every letter is pronounced. The exceptions to this are the letters representing m, r and l, which are sometimes written but not pronounced, due to phonological processes such as lenition (the weakening of a consonant, which can lead to its not being pronounced at all). The letters representing h and s are also written but not pronounced in some contexts where they serve as grammatical markers in a grammatical rule which is undergoing change. The order of the letters roughly follows that of the Greek alphabet, with some influence from early Iranian scripts such as Pahlavi.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGeorgian writing currently uses only one case, although previous alphabets have been bicameral. There have been some attempts, notably on the part of Akaki Shanidze, to use the letters of the old Asomtavruli alphabet as upper-case letters, but this system is unofficial and has been used very sporadically. It is read from left to right, with spaces between words and a punctuation mark to indicate the end of sentences. No diacritics are used. Within a word, letters can be spaced out to add emphasis.

The origins of the script are not clear; two opposing views claim that it was either created by a single individual (most popularly cited as Constantine/St. Cyril), or that it was derived from Greek cursive forms and was already in use by the time St. Cyril arrived in the area. Cubberley suggests in The Slavic Alphabets that the Slavs themselves created the script based on Greek cursive letters a few centuries before St Cyril and St Methodius mission in 860, and that St. Cyril formalized the system and added some new letters based on Coptic, Hebrew or Armenian forms, to represent sounds not found in Greek. What is known is that Glagolitic writing was used throughout the Balkans in tandem with Cyrillic until the 13th century, after which time it was largely replaced by Cyrillic.

The square form (also sometimes called Croatian Glagolitic) was used from the 13th to the 19th century in Croatia, where it is still used for decorative purposes, especially on the island of Krk.

At that time, Greek was written from right to left or in \u003ca href=page.php?item_id=glossary#boust\u003eboustrophedon\u003c/a\u003e style, though it is now written from left to right.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe alphabet currently contains twenty-four letters; six archaic letters have either been dropped or are now used as numerals. Some letters have variant forms. In writing the Greek language these variations are purely stylistic, although in mathematic and scientific contexts they can represent different concepts, for example ϖ, a variant form of pi, which is used in fluid dynamics to represent the angular frequency of a wave. The lower case sigma σ has a variant form, word-finally ς. Although this is a contextual form, it can be semantically significant; a word ending with σ must be an abbreviation of some other word having σ word-internally, whereas a word ending with ς must be a single non-abbreviated word.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHistorically, there were a number of ligatures used in Greek writing. Many of these have dropped from modern usage, although some remain, particularly in handwritten text and printed titles.

In the early 80s, the Greek Government instituted a language reform which, among other things, introduced a single diacritic (\u003cspan class=Em\u003etonos\u003c/span\u003e) in place of the three accent system. When two vowels form a diphthong, the accent is placed on the second vowel. Breathing marks were historically used but have fallen from current usage.

It is also used alongside the Devanagari script for writing a number of languages used by the Bhil people, one of Indias largest indigenous groups. The script is related to Devanagari, with modifications to some of the letters, and without the headstroke which characterizes most of the Nagari scripts. The loss of the headstroke reflects the scripts origins in informal writing; until the mid-19th century it was used primarily for bookkeeping and personal correspondence, but since printing facilities have become widely available to Gujarati speakers the script is used in schools, for printing books and newspapers, in government offices and public signage, and is one of the official scripts of India.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGujarati is written from left to right.

Consonants are ordered in rows; velar, palatal, retroflex, dental, labial.

There are no specific tone marks in Gurmukhi writing, but certain aspects of the orthography carry information about tones. In word-initial position, a historically voiced aspirate is pronounced as a voiceless non-aspirate, and indicates that the following vowel carries a low tone. For example, the word written as \u003cspan class=Em\u003eghaṛ\u003c/span\u003e is pronounced kàṛ (house). In word-final position, the same letters are pronounced as voiced non-aspirates, and indicate that the preceding vowel carries a high tone. for example the word written as \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekujh\u003c/span\u003e is pronounced kúj (something). The letter \u003cspan class=Em\u003eha\u003c/span\u003e has a special role in marking tone. At the start of a word it carries no tone information but represents the sound hə, but written elsewhere in a word it carries no phonetic value but represents high tone on the preceding vowel. For example, the word written as \u003cspan class=Em\u003etīh\u003c/span\u003e is pronounced tí (thirty).

Prior to this, Korean had been written in Chinese characters, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehanja\u003c/span\u003e in Korean, but this was laborious. A given Chinese character could be used to represent a spoken syllable, irrespective of its original Chinese meaning, or it could be used to represent the Korean word with the closest meaning to its original. Reading was difficult because the intended function of the character was not always apparent. Hangul was developed by King Sejong to combat the difficulties associate with writing Korean in \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehanja\u003c/span\u003e. However it was not universally accepted, and for a time was prohibited by Japanese colonial authorities.

Although this is obviously a subjective statement, it is true that the script was designed to be structurally very well ordered.

It is commonly assumed that the Sinitic languages (Chinese languages) are monosyllabic, and that one written character = one syllable = one word. However, there are many polysyllabic words in both the ancient and modern lexicons, and the average length of a word in Mandarin is two syllables. These words are represented using combinations of characters, each representing one syllable. There are some exceptions to this rule, in the form of unofficial but widely used single characters representing polysyllabic Chinese words, such as \u003cspan class=Em\u003etúshūguăn\u003c/span\u003e library and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ewèntí\u003c/span\u003e question. This is common when the characters are used for writing Japanese, due to different phonological rules governing the language. A single character may frequently represent a polysyllabic word in Japanese and some of the other languages for which Han characters are used.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eChinese writing is believed to be the oldest form of writing in East Asia, having apparently been spontaneously created during the second half of the second millenium BC. There is no evidence of any other writing in use in the area at this time, nor of any outside influence from a literate society. The earliest inscriptions were on bones and shells used in divination during the Shang dynasty (1600-1046 BC), and employed a set of logographic symbols now known as the Oracle Bone Script. Although these symbols have been extinct since the end of the Bronze Age, the modern Han characters are direct descendants from these.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHan writing is still sometimes referred to as logographic, but most linguists and sinographers (scholars of Chinese) agree that the script might be best described as a phonetically imprecise syllabary with strong semantic qualities. The script functions differently from a purely phonetic script such as an alphabet in that a single character can regularly carry semantic weight in and of itself without needing to be combined with other elements. In addition, the same sound can be represented by different symbols. For example, the word \u003cspan class=Em\u003eyī\u003c/span\u003e is the Modern Standard Mandarin pronunciation of the words meaning one, clothing, depend on, and regional pronunciations of he/she, but each of these is represented by a different character. It may be that in earlier varieties of the language these words were pronounced differently but over time have collapsed into a single sound.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere have been numerous attempts to classify Han characters by phonetic rather than semantic criteria, notably, Berhnard Karlgrens work in the 1920s-40s and Zhou Youguangs in the 1970s. Most attempts have identified 850-1250 phonetic elements. Although the characters are made up of recurring phonetic components, their shapes and proportions change in combination, so each character is a discrete entity and must be stored as such in the users memory or in a font. There are estimated to be 60,000 Han characters comprising the full set, but a competent grasp of approximately 2,500 characters is considered by educators to be essential for basic reading and writing skills, and about 5,200 characters are estimated to account for over 99% of the characters used in typical texts.

Perhaps due to its inaccessible location, it is one of the few indigenous Philippine scripts which has not been replaced by the Latin script. It is of Brahmic origin, descended through Old Kawi, although its history is difficult to trace in detail due to the perishable nature of bamboo, the surface on which it is traditionally inscribed. The script is an abugida, in which each of the 15 consonants has an inherent a vowel. The other two vowels in the inventory, i and u, are marked syllable-finally by a diacritic positioned above or below (or to the left or right of) the syllable, often forming a ligature. There are also three vowel characters representing syllable-initial a, i, or u. Hanunóo words are predominantly disyllabic, and tend to be in CVCV form, although CVC syllables are also possible. In the case of a CVC syllable, the final consonant is often not written, so the reader must determine from context the correct pronunciation. Letters are not ordered or learned in any particular sequence; the characters used to write ones own name are commonly acquired first.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Hanunóo script is unusual in that it is written in upward - that is, away from the body - vertical columns which are read from left to right. The Hanunóo can typically read with equal skill in all directions, so characters can be orientated either horizontally or vertically within these columns, as long as they are consistent throughout the text. As shown in the image below, the position of the vowel diacritic is determined by the orientation of the consonant - when the consonant is horizontal, the diacritic appears above or below it; when vertical, to its left or right.

It is used for writing the varieties of the Chinese language spoken in these place. There is some debate as to whether varieties of Chinese (many of which are mutually unintelligible) should be classified as separate languages or dialects of a single language. Speakers of Chinese tend to perceive them as dialects, but some linguists consider this identification to be inappropriate. Given the high level of internal variation in the spoken language, it is the written form which has provided a means for unifying Chinese culture, as the same characters are used for representing the same concepts across dialects/languages. There are two styles of Chinese characters; traditional and simplified. The traditional form has been used since the 5th century AD, and the simplified form is generally associated with the formation of the PRC in 1949, who introduced the script in an effort to increase literacy, although some non-standard simplified forms existed long before this time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe simplified forms of characters were created by modifying the traditional forms so that complex components of some characters were omitted entirely or replaced by a simpler component. Some traditional characters were replaced in print by their cursive equivalents, which tend to be visually simpler. Occasionally, less complex ancient forms of a character were adopted in place of the standard traditional form. Many simplified characters do not bear any immediate resemblance to their traditional equivalents unless the reader knows what modifications were applied. Some traditional forms were not modified at all so are the same in both scripts.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a problem of underdifferentiation in Simplified Han writing; reducing the number of strokes makes characters easier to write, but also reduces their distinctness for the reader by the same measure.

The simplified script is now the official script of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and of Singapore, but the traditional characters are still used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as for aesthetic purposes in the PRC and Singapore.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are five principles of character formation which have been used in developing the script. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003epictographic principle\u003c/span\u003e refers to signs which visually resemble the thing they represent, for example a dot within a circle for representing the concept sun. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003esimple indicative principle\u003c/span\u003e is related to this, but applies to more abstract concepts, such as above which is represented by a particular mark above a horizontal line, or below which is represented by a related mark below a horizontal line. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003ecompound indicative principle\u003c/span\u003e is used for compound signs, for example the combination of the sun and moon signs for representing the concept bright. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003ephonetic loan principle\u003c/span\u003e has been used in developing the signs for homphonous words. For example, the sound \u003cspan class=Em\u003eləg\u003c/span\u003e archaically meant both wheat and to come, so a character visually resembling a sheaf of wheat is still used for representing the word come, although the two words are no longer pronounced alike. The last principle is the \u003cspan class=Em\u003esemantic-phonetic principle\u003c/span\u003e, whereby homophonous words represented by the same character are distinguished by adding a semantic element, sometimes called a determinative, classifier, signific or radical.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script is neither purely phonetic nor purely logographic; rather, it can be seen as a very large and phonetically imprecise syllabary having a strong semantic element. Neither the phonetic nor the semantic component alone gives an exact indication of sound or meaning, but the combined phonetic and semantic associations provided by the character enables the reader to deduce the pronunciation and the meaning represented. For example, the character representing the concept sprain (ankle), pronounced \u003cspan class=Em\u003ebié\u003c/span\u003e is a combination of the phonetic element representing the sound \u003cspan class=Em\u003ebì\u003c/span\u003e, which means - among other things - shabby, and the semantic radical meaning foot.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBoth traditional and simplified Han characters have been designed to fit within the same sized square; there are no ascenders or descenders. Traditional Han characters are much more complex than their simplified equivalents, as would be expected. Characters are written with 12 basic strokes, but a given character can contain between 1 and 64 of these strokes. Each stroke is always written in the same direction, and there is a particular order in which strokes must be written when composing a character.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTraditional Han is written both vertically (more common in Taiwan) and horizontally (more common in Hong Kong and Macau).

It was created by Shong Lue, who claimed to have been sent by God to teach the script to the Hmong people, following a series of divine revelations. He developed the script in four stages, the second and third of which are the forms in most widespread current use.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script is unique in that syllables are written in the reverse order to which they are spoken. So, although the script as a whole is read from left to right, each syllable is written from right to left. Also unusual is that the diphthong au is the inherent vowel in a consonant, as opposed to the more usual a, ə or o.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are twenty consonant symbols which can appear at the start of a syllable. These combine with two diacritics to represent the sixty syllable-initial phonemes of the Hmong language. Use of these diacritics is not systematic, and the pronunciation of a given symbol+diacritic is not necessarily predictable from the sum of its two parts. For example, the sign for c when combined with a dot diacritic produces ntʃh, and when combined with a tack diacritic produces ts. But the sign for ntʃ when combined with a dot diacritic produces tʃ, and when combined with a tack diacritic produces ph. As the script was developed, this system was redesigned so that in the final version it is quite systematic. However, the final version is not the version in use.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTwenty-six symbols are used to represent the thirteen vowel phonemes. Each vowel can be written in two ways, each of which bears a (different) inherent tone. There are eight tones in the Hmong language. The inherent tone can be modified using one of four diacritics, which are used in a systematic way so that all 107 vowel + tone combinations can be represented.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePunctuation was introduced to the script in 1969, based on Latin punctuation. There are also script-specific symbols to indicate reduplication, exclamation, the sung or chanted nature of a text, percent, and ampersand.

These were used phonetically to represent similar-sounding Japanese syllables; the meanings of the characters were initially ignored. However, as each kanji corresponds to only one syllable, in order to write a polysyllabic Japanese word, of which there are many, several kanji had to be employed. As kanji frequently consist of a large number of strokes, this was a laborious process. A simplified cursive style of writing began to be used by Japanese women around the 7th and 8th centuries; from this cursive style the hiragana characters developed. In modern written Japanese, many kanji characters can be read in two ways. \u003cspan class=Em\u003eOn\u003c/span\u003e-readings are based on the pronunciation of the Chinese character at the time of borrowing, irrespective of meaning, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekun\u003c/span\u003e-readings represent a Japanese morpheme corresponding to the meaning of a particular character.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKatakana was created shortly after hiragana, by students of Buddhism who needed some kind of phonetic shorthand in which they could rapidly take notes during lectures.

The script may be derived from Old Turkic writing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is some discussion regarding the direction of writing; it appears that Old Hungarian was written both from right to left and from left to right.

Academic preference is generally for a left to right directionality, but modern users are more likely to write it from right to left.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are 45 basic letters in the script, which are able to represent all the sounds of Hungarian. That is not to say the orthography was phonemic; vowels were only written where it was ambiguous to omit them. Letters could be combined to form numerous ligatures. Historically, ligatures were not standardized, but used freely and inconsistently throughout handwritten texts. The same sequence of sounds could optionally be written with multiple signs or with a ligature. The script employed a single case, although the first letter of proper nouns was sometimes written slightly larger than the rest. There were also some non-alphabetic symbols, the functions of which seem to be unclear.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAround the year 1000, the first Hungarian king, István/Stephen I was crowned. Under his rule, the country officially switched to using the Latin script, though some examples of religious texts written in the script have been dated to that period.

Since 1915 various attempts have been made to revive the script, with limited success.

Until the 7th or 8th century, the Japanese language was written exclusively in these Chinese characters. Initially these were used phonetically to represent similar-sounding Japanese syllables, regardless of their meaning in written Chinese. However, the process of writing Japanese solely in kanji was laborious; each symbol consisted of a number of strokes and only represented one syllable. Two simplified forms of writing began to emerge around the 7th century. The modern hiragana script developed from a simplified cursive style originally developed by women, who were discouraged from learning kanji, and katakana was developed by Buddhist scholars who wrote only one element of each kanji symbol as a form of shorthand.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn modern written Japanese, many kanji characters can be read in two ways. \u003cspan class=Em\u003eOn\u003c/span\u003e-readings are based on the Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time of borrowing, irrespective of any subsequent changes in meaning, while \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekun\u003c/span\u003e-readings are based on the pronunciation of the Japanese word having the same meaning. For example, the loan word \u003cspan class=Em\u003enin\u003c/span\u003e is based on the sound of the Mandarin word \u003cspan class=Em\u003erén \u003c/span\u003e person, which is written with the character 人. The native Japanese word having the same meaning - person - is pronounced \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehito\u003c/span\u003e. So the character 人 can be pronounced either \u003cspan class=Em\u003enin\u003c/span\u003e (the on-reading), or \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehito\u003c/span\u003e (the kun-reading).

There are 48 written symbols, also called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekana\u003c/span\u003e, each representing one mora, essentially a short syllable. Syllables with long vowels count as two morae and are represented in writing by two kana. There are 5 kana for writing independent vowels, 1 for writing the syllabic nasal /n/, and 42 for writing various CV syllables. To enable all 102 spoken syllables to be written using only these 48 symbols, diacritics are used. \u003cspan class=Em\u003eDakuten\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003enigoriten\u003c/span\u003e can be added to a character to mark voicing, where it is distinctive, and a small circle \u003cspan class=Em\u003emaru\u003c/span\u003e is written to the upper right of the symbols \u003cspan class=Em\u003eha\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehi\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehu\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehe\u003c/span\u003e, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003eho\u003c/span\u003e, to represent \u003cspan class=Em\u003epa\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003epi\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003epu\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003epe\u003c/span\u003e, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003epo\u003c/span\u003e.

The Kharoshthi script descended from Aramaic and was used in what is now Northern Pakistan and Eastern Afghanistan during the 4th or 5th century BC. It was used for about 700 years for writing a group of vernacular middle Indo-Aryan dialects collectively termed Prakrit. There has been some evidence that local variants of Kharoshthi writing were used for even longer than this along the Silk Route, but these too later died out without leaving any descendants.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKharoshthi was an abugida based on the graphic syllable called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eakṣara\u003c/span\u003e, which contains an inherent a vowel. Other vowels were written by attaching diacritics to the akṣara, which overrode the inherent a. Initial vowels having no preceding consonant were written using a dummy consonant letter in which the consonant was silent but the inherent a was pronounced. Vowel diacritics could be attached to this letter as to any other consonant letter. Vowel length was generally not written, except in some later documents which used a diacritic stroke to indicate a long vowel.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script was written from right to left in a cursive style.

Two more consonants that are included in Unicode are not in everyday use. Like many of the Brahmic abugidas, each symbol comprises a consonant and an inherent vowel. However, unlike most other Brahmic scripts, Khmer has two registers of consonants, one containing an inherent a and one containing an inherent o. Most consonants have two different letterforms for these two registers. Those that do not have a second form can be modified by one of two diacritics to indicate a change of register. Each consonant can also appear in a subscript form, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ecoeng\u003c/span\u003e.

It is often claimed to be a Bihari script despite its use and influence extending beyond the state of Bihar. Kaithi has been used for writing the Bhojpuri, Maghadi, Urdu, Awadhi, Maithili, and Bengali languages since the 16th century. Its use was generally discouraged under British rule in India, except in the state of Bihar, where it was officially sanctioned for use in government offices - hence the association with that state. In other areas it was used primarily by the \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekayastha\u003c/span\u003e caste, a Brahmin caste which consists largely of writers by trade. The script was widely used until the early 1900s, and there is some evidence that it is still used for personal correspondence in rural areas.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKaithi writing is sometimes described as a cursive form of Devanagari. Many of the letters closely resemble Devanagari letters in shape, although it is generally written without a headstroke but with serifs, especially in printing. Both Kaithi and Devanagari descended from the the Gupta branch of Brahmi writing and are structurally very similar, but the differences between them are significant enough that literacy in one does not guarantee literacy in the other. The script was largely used by Brahmins. However George Grierson, the linguist largely responsible for the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eLinguistic Survey of India\u003c/span\u003e carried out between 1894 and 1928, notes in his 1899 \u003cspan class=Em\u003eHandbook to the Kaithi Character\u003c/span\u003e that in some places Kaithi writing was associated with the lower classes, for whom education in Devanagari was considered an unnecessary luxury.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Kaithi script is an abugida - each consonant letter represents a CV syllable where the default vowel is a. Other vowels are normally written using dependent vowel diacritics, unless they are at the start of a word, in which case they are written with an independent vowel letter. Sometimes in handwriting, non-decomposable consonant + vowel ligatures are used. A \u003cspan class=Em\u003evirama\u003c/span\u003e symbol is used to cancel the vowel at the end of consonant-final words. There are thirty-five consonant letters and either eight or ten vowel letters. Sources disagree as to whether the script contains short i and u letters; those which do not support these letters state that their long forms are used for writing both long and short vowels. There is also some controversy as to whether a \u003cspan class=Em\u003evocalic r\u003c/span\u003e letter exists. The collation order of letters follows the Devanagari model based on articulatory phonetics.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eConsonant clusters are represented irregularly from language to language.

For example in Awadhi, the Hindi word karma is pronounced karam and written the same way. Where this does not occur, clusters can be written with half-forms of the letters, with a non-decomposable ligature, with the virama symbol, or they may be written with the full forms of both letters and the pronunciation deduced from the readers knowledge of the language. The decision depends largely on the writers personal preference, or on the limitations of the font being used. Ligatures are more commonly used for writing the Maithili language.

The Limbu language is also written in the Devanagari script. It was first brought to the attention of the wider world by the scholars Francis Buchanan Hamilton, A. Campbell and Brian Hodgson in the mid to late 19th century. The origins of the script are unknown; it is evident from its structure that it is of Brahmic derivation, and appears to be closely related to the Lepcha script. Limbu folklore relates that in the 9th century the Limbu king Sirijanga prayed to the goddess Saravati for wisdom as to how to devise a script for his people, and in response she revealed the story of creation to him, written in the script. The original script was modified in the mid 20th century by Imansin Cemjon and B.B. Subba, who increased the number of signs and re-assigned new values to some of the original symbols.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Limbu script is an abugida; every letter represents a CV syllable having the inherent vowel ɔ.

This diacritic overrides the inherent ɔ vowel. There is also a diacritic mark for representing ɔ, which is not regularly used as it is somewhat redundant.

In terms of shape, the symbols comprise abstract forms, human heads - often faces in profile - and hands, and parts of animal bodies\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Mayan script consists in total of more than one thousand different symbols. Some sounds or words can be written using a number of different symbols (allographs), and, conversely, some symbols can have numerous different pronunciations or meanings. In addition, many symbols were used only during a specific time period or in a certain location. Thus, there were likely never more than 500 symbols in use at any given time.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Mayan symbols which are read as phonetic elements represent either a bare vowel or a consonant+vowel syllable. This is not perfectly suited to the Mayan languages, as most spoken syllables end in a consonant, and may also contain consonant clusters within the word. Sometimes, the final consonant is left unwritten. In other cases, a synharmony rule is applied, according to which CVC syllables are represented using two symbols, each representing a CV-syllable. In the reading, the second vowel is silent. The rule also dictated that the symbol for the second CV syllable must contain a vowel which matched the vowel of the first syllable, even though it remained unspoken. This is known as an echo vowel.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSymbols were classified according to their size and position as either main symbols or affixes. Logographs and phonetic symbols were often used in combination; the phonetic symbols formed a complement to the logograph to further clarify the words pronunciation and meaning. The ways in which symbols could be combined were very flexible; two symbols could overlap or be conflated with one another, or one symbol was shrunk and placed inside another as an infix.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAs well as logographic and phonetic symbols, there is another class of symbols called semantograms. These are not pronounced aloud, but serve either to disambiguate symbols with more than one possible interpretation, or to identify the class to which a particular word belongs. Diacritics are used, most notably a pair of dots which indicates repetition of a syllable.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMayan texts were generally written from left to right in columns two symbols wide.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince Mayan writing came to the attention of the wider world in the 1560s, numerous attempts have been made to decipher it. These were largely unsuccessful until Yuri Knorosov demonstrated the phonetic aspect of symbols that were previously believed to be logographic, and also identified the vowel harmony rules governing the representation of final consonants. Since his work was published in the 1950s about 80% of Mayan texts have been deciphered, relating to community matters such as birth, death and marriage, as well as historical records of warfare and rulers, and royal deeds.\u003c/p\u003e","diacritics":false,"direction":"ltr","direction_notes":"vertical (LTR)","family":"American","ligatures":"none","name":"Mayan hieroglyphs","numeral_systems":null,"open_type_tag":"none","reordering":false,"requires_font":false,"sample":"","sample_img":"","script":"Maya","split_graphs":false,"status":"Historical","type":"logo-syllabary","unicode":true,"unicode_pdf":"","whitespace":"none"},{"alphabet_languages":null,"baseline":"bottom","bibles":null,"case":false,"complex_positioning":"no","contextual_forms":true,"description":"\u003cp\u003eMedefaidrin is a script created for the Medefaidrin language, an artificial language used by the Oberi Okaime church, an indigenous Christian church located in the Cross-River State of Nigeria.

The script is an abugida; each letter represents a consonant-vowel syllable. Unmarked letters contain an inherent ə vowel, and other vowels are represented by writing one of seven (in the modern orthography - older texts use twelve) diacritics above, below, to the left or to the right of the base letter.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script contains twenty-seven basic letters, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eIyek Ipi\u003c/span\u003e, of which three are vowels, and a set of \u003cspan class=Em\u003eLonsum\u003c/span\u003e unreleased letters, which are variant forms of eight letters for use at the end of a word.

Either way, a consonantal system worked well for the syllabic structure of the Phoenician language, but when the script spread to Greece, it was not practical to write the Greek language using only consonants. The Greeks instead used some of the consonant letters which represented sounds they did not use, to represent vowels. For example, the letter \u003cspan class=Em\u003ealeph\u003c/span\u003e in Phoenician writing represented a laryngeal consonant (the exact quality of which is not known; some scholars suggest a glottal stop), but the Greeks used it to represent the vowel a.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe shapes of early Phoenician letters were equal in height, but around the 9th century BC, writers in Tyre began lengthening the vertical ascenders and slightly slanting the axis of the letters.

Historians writing shortly after that period (Nizamuddin Ahmad, Bada’uni) claim that Babur used his script to transcribe a copy of the Koran, which he sent as an offering to Mecca, but that by the time Babur’s grandson, Akbar, was in power the script was not being used. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt is thought that there may actually be two separate Baburi scripts, but more investigation is needed to determine whether that is the case.

Dhives Akuru descended from the southern Brahmi family of scripts. The development of the script can be divided into three periods. Initially it was very similar to the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Gran\u003eGrantha\u003c/a\u003e script from which it was derived, then, around the 12th century, it developed into what is known as Evela Akuru, which is essentially an archaic form of Dhives Akuru. The script in its latest form developed around the 14th century, and was widely used until the early 18th century, when it began to be supplanted by the Thaana script. The two scripts were used synchronously for some time, but by the early 19th century Dhives Akuru had all but died out, with only a few atolls (groups of islands) in the south of the country reportedly using it as late as the early 1900s. The two scripts are genetically unrelated and bear very little resemblance to each other, aside from the shapes of a few Thaana characters which appear to have been based on Dhives Akuru characters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDhives Akuru is written from left to right. As would be expected given its derivation from Brahmi, it is an abugida, with each consonant letter representing a syllable containing an inherent vowel. This vowel can be changed by the addition of a vowel diacritic. The script includes 27 consonant letters; 10 independent vowel letters (for writing vowels that are not preceded by a consonant); 10 vowel diacritics; digits from 0-9; and 4 other diacritics: the \u003ca href=page.php?item_id=glossary#virama\u003evirama\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ca href=page.php?item_id=glossary#candrabindu\u003ecandrabindu\u003c/a\u003e, a prenasalisation marker, and a \u003ca href=page.php?item_id=glossary#gemination\u003egemination\u003c/a\u003e marker. Somewhat unusually, the virama sign has been extended to serve a number of other functions as well as its regular vowel-cancellation role.

This language was also written in the Manichaean and Syriac scripts. Sogdian writing derives from the Aramaic script and was used from approximately the 1st to the 13th centuries AD, during which time three main varieties emerged, the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eAncient Letters\u003c/span\u003e, the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eSutra\u003c/span\u003e style and the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eUyghur\u003c/span\u003e style. This third style should not be confused with the Old Uyghur alphabet, although in some sources Sutra Sogdian is simply called Sogdian, and Uyghur Sogdian is simply called Uyghur, due to the latter being widely used to write the Turkic Uyghur language in the 8th century. Some sources also call the Sutra and Uyghur styles \u003cspan class=Em\u003eformal\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ecursive\u003c/span\u003e respectively.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eAncient Letters\u003c/span\u003e, the letters are distinct in shape and unconnected in writing. This is the oldest form of the script. Around the 5th century, a cursive bookhand, \u003cspan class=Em\u003eSutra\u003c/span\u003e, was developed for writing Buddhist religious texts. Letters are sometimes more difficult to distinguish in this style. The latest form, \u003cspan class=Em\u003eUyghur\u003c/span\u003e, was developed in the 7th century and has proved very difficult to decipher due to many of the letters being too similar for modern-day scholars to distinguish. This was also a cursive style.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Sogdian script was an abjad, that is, vowels were optional. It was written from right to left using seventeen letters, many of which had contextual forms depending on their position (initial, medial or final) in the word. Some letters represented up to three sounds. Diacritics were used (inconsistently) to represent additional sounds, for example a dot could be written under a z to represent ž.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSogdian writing retained the Aramaic principle of starting every written word with a consonant, so the \u003cspan class=Em\u003ealeph\u003c/span\u003e (glottal stop) symbol was always written before a word-initial vowel. When word-internal vowels were written, they were often represented using the w or y letters. At first, only long vowels were represented, but later manuscripts use these letters for short vowels also. This left no distinction in writing between long and short vowels, so a tendency developed to insert an \u003cspan class=Em\u003ealeph\u003c/span\u003e before a word-internal long vowel.

It was the first \u003cspan class=Em\u003ephonemic\u003c/span\u003e script created for writing a signed language, although it was not created for the Deaf to write down their language for daily use, and it never came to be used for this purpose. Rather, it has always been used for linguistic research and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUntil the 1960s, signed languages were not viewed as “real” languages but as simple mimes with no consistent linguistic structure. Stokoe’s aim in creating his script was to demonstrate that American Sign Language was built up from the same elements as spoken languages. Spoken languages are analysed in terms of segments (for example phonemes) and features (the elements that make up a phoneme such as voicing, place of articulation, vowel height etc). Stokoe Notation demonstrates that signed languages can be analysed in the same terms. The segments are signs instead of sounds, and the features are hand shape, location with respect to the body, orientation, and direction of movement.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script is neither a logography (which generally represent nothing smaller than a morpheme), nor a syllabary (which generally represent nothing smaller than a syllable) nor an alphabet (which generally represent nothing smaller than a phoneme). Rather, Stokoe Notation represents each feature of each segment. There are three types of symbols. In representing a given sign, the location symbol is written first, then the handshape symbol, then the orientation/direction symbol. So the three components in ͜ 5x, which represents the sign meaning \u003cspan class=Em\u003emother\u003c/span\u003e, are ‘‘⏝’, indicating that the sign is made with the hand at the chin, 5, indicating that it uses a spread hand, and x indicating that the thumb touches the chin.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe fifty-five symbols used in Stokoe’s original script are based on the shapes of Latin letters, punctuation, and numbers.

Tulu is a Dravidian language spoken by almost 2 million people in the South Indian states of Karnataka (coastal region) and Kerala (Kasaragod district).

As well as being used for the recording of long religious texts and poems, the script was widely used for writing Hindu mantras. The gradual demise of the Tulu script has largely been attributed to Christian missionaries to South India who published a large body of literature in the Tulu language, using the Kannada script, the closest script with printing facilities.

In 1677 Fr. le Clercq adapted these marks to form a fully functioning writing system, which he used to transcribe prayers. Although he is generally credited with the systemization of the Micmac writing, his system was not widely adopted by the people. It was not until his sucessor, Father Maillard, further revised the system that it began to be widely used. Maillard also oversaw the production of the Micmac prayer book, a hieroglyph manuscript which continued to be copied by hand for 100 years.

Some overlap between ideographic and phonetic symbols is evident - a single character is used for representing both you and w/ω, and for both spear and ŋg/k, for example - although the extent to which this overlap occurred is uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNumerals from 1-10 are also represented in the script.

It is currently in its third revision. Unlike the other scripts for writing signed languages, HamNoSys is not intended as a practical writing tool for everyday communication. Rather, its purpose is analogous to that of the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is used to transcribe the sounds of any given spoken language in a consistent way. In the same way, HamNoSys is based on the phonology of signed languages and designed with the capacity to transcribe every natural signed language in the world using consistent symbols across languages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHamNoSys is an alphabet, written using 210 largely iconic characters. Based on Stokoe’s 4-parameter model, characters represent hand shape, hand orientation, location relative to other parts of the body, and movement. Each sign (or word) must be written by assigning a value to each of these parameters. Unlike Stokoe’s model, HamNoSys also provides a symmetry operator for representing symmetrical two-handed signs, and a limited number of non-manual components. Non-manual phonological elements can be represented in part by replacing the hand grapheme with the symbol for another body part, such as the head. The parameters of a sign are written in the following order:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cul class=dListUnordered\u003e \u003cli\u003eSymmetry Operator\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eNon-manual Components\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eHandshape\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eHand Position\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eLocation\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eMovement\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003eSmaller facial movements such as raised eyebrows or puffed out cheeks are more complex to represent.

Its origin is a source of contention: some researchers believe it to have been invented in the 13th century, or possibly as early as the 7th century; others consider it more likely to have been invented as recently as the 18th century.

The Dongba religious corpus, comprising some one thousand ceremonies, is contained in Dongba script manuscripts. Today the script is still in use in the Lijiang region, not only to write scriptures but also to keep business records.

There is considerable controversy surrounding both the people and their language and script. Since coming to the attention of the wider world in the 1980s, neither has been extensively studied, and this lack of factual knowledge has led to speculation and numerous theories about their origins. These range from the supernatural to suggestions that the Eskaya are a cult or simply an impoverished tribe that concocted a “lost language” in order to attract government attention and funding. None of these theories has ever been proven.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Eskaya people speak the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/lang/ceb\u003eCebuano\u003c/a\u003e language in their day-to-day lives, and there is no evidence that the Eskayan language has ever had any mother-tongue speakers. It is used primarily for songs, prayers, teaching, traditional literature, some public signage, and to exclude non-Eskayas from a conversation. The language and script are said to have been created by a man known as Pinay, the ancestor of the Eskaya people, but it is unclear whether this is myth or historical fact. They were revived by a rebel soldier, Mariano Datahan, who founded a utopian community in the Bohol region of the Philippines in the early 20th century and taught them to his followers. A few speakers claim that Pinay and Datahan were in fact one and the same person; others, that they lived a few hundred years apart. Because so little is known about the history of the people, it is impossible to verify either of these claims. Both the language and the script continue to be taught in purpose-built schools run by volunteers, where attendance is voluntary but carries some prestige. The little linguistic analysis that has been carried out on the language indicates that it is grammatically Cebuano but with a substituted lexicon. This correlation is so strong that, where there is a set of homophones in Cebuano, the corresponding Eskayan words will also be homophones.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Eskaya script is of central importance to the Eskaya people, who consider writing to be the “true” form of the language; a written word is not seen as a representation of the spoken form but vice-versa. Similarly, a Cebuano-language text written in the Eskaya script is deemed to be an Eskaya text, but an Eskayan-language text written in the Latin script is not. The script is an alphasyllabary; most characters represent syllables but some represent individual phones. The full character set contains 1,065 characters, but a reduced set of 46 (called the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eabidiha\u003c/span\u003e) is considered to be the ‘core’ group, and these are taught first - many of these can be either alphabetic or syllabic, depending on context. Of the syllabic characters, many represent C+V or C+V+C sequences, but some are as complex as C+C+V+C+C. At least one character is trisyllabic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUnlike many syllabic scripts, there is no universal inherent vowel. Many of the characters in the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eabidiha\u003c/span\u003e have a one-syllable ‘name’ when they are being recited, and this dictates their syllabic value. For example, the character called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ebi\u003c/span\u003e can be used syllabically to represent /bi/, but /i/ cannot be considered the inherent vowel, as the character called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eka\u003c/span\u003e represents /ka/, the character called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehu\u003c/span\u003e represents /hu/, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMany syllabic characters consist of an \u003cspan class=Em\u003einahan\u003c/span\u003e (‘mother’) - a core vowel element - and a \u003cspan class=Em\u003esinyas\u003c/span\u003e (‘gesture’) - an \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/glossary#onset\u003eonset\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/glossary#coda\u003ecoda\u003c/a\u003e consonant. For example, the syllable /da/ is written with the \u003cspan class=Em\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e character (the mother), with a small closed curl (the gesture, representing the /d/ onset) attached to it. However, these cannot be said to be simple vowel+diacritic combinations, as the \u003cspan class=Em\u003esinyas\u003c/span\u003e is not always predictable or consistent - in other vowel combinations with /d/ the closed curl is replaced by another symbol. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome character shapes resemble Latin letters but by and large they are based on the human anatomy. For example, the syllable called \u003cspan class=Em\u003egi\u003c/span\u003e is written using a concave curve, followed by a dash, followed by a convex curve, which represents the two ears either side of the head. The script is anthropomorphised in other ways also; one text describes the letters doing the human work of planting different edible plants. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOf the 1,065 characters in the syllabary, some represent sounds which are not attested in the language. The reason for this is unknown, but it may be that the original purpose of the writing system was to transliterate from another writing system - probably Latin - rather than to transcribe a language. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eEskaya is written from left to right, with words separated by spaces. It uses Latin punctuation, except for the question mark and full stop, which are distinct. Eskaya uses a decimal numeric system, and the script includes symbols for representing 0-9.

The main differences are that retroflex ɭ and ɳ are represented in writing but have assimilated to alveolar l and n in speech, that three vowel sounds ə, a and ā are represented by only two letters, the pronunciation of which is generally predictable from a set of contextual rules, and that there are two letters transcribed ṣ and ś but both pronounced ʃ.

Sora is in the Munda language family. It is also sometmes called Saora or Savara, but is not to be confused with the Savara language in the Dravidian family. According to the Ethnologue, Sora (Munda) is given the language code srb, and Savara (Dravidian) is given the language code svr.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are three scripts which have been created specifically for writing Munda languages; Sora Sompeng for the Sora language, Ol Chiki for the Santali language, and Varang Kshiti for the Ho language. However, these three scripts are not visually similar and are not derived from a common source, all having been created by influential community leaders to replace non-native scripts.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Sora language has also been written in an IPA-based script developed by Christian missionaries, and in the Telugu and Oriya scripts. In the 1930s there was conflict within the community as to which of these was best-suited to the language. To resolve the conflict, Mangei Gomango, the son-in-law of an influential Sora leader, introduced the Sora Sompeng script in 1936. Sora tradition states that the script itself is a divine incarnation of the deity called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eAkshara Brahma\u003c/span\u003e, but other scholars suggest that the shapes of the letters are loosely based on Latin/IPA letters, and the additional loops are based on Telugu writing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are twenty-four letters in the Sora Sompeng syllabary, named for the twenty-four deities in the Sora pantheon. The eighteen consonant letters carry an inherent ə vowel (ɔ may or may not be written post-consonantally, therefore, the inherent vowel could be said to merge ə and ɔ). Unlike many of the South Asian syllabaries, there are no vowel diacritics. Vowels other than ə are written both initially and post-consonantally using six independent vowel letters. When written post-consonantally, the implication is that they override the inherent ə vowel. The script does not appear to be ideally suited for the Sora language. Two letters, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ec\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ev\u003c/span\u003e, are never used. Some vowel letters are used for representing more than one sound, for example the letter \u003cspan class=Em\u003eo\u003c/span\u003e can represent either o and ɔ. Also unusual among South Asian syllabaries is the absence of both conjunct forms and a vowel-killer stroke; consonant clusters are written using linear combinations of consonant letters in their full (i.e. CV) form. It may be that the inclusion or deletion of vowels between consonants is governed by rules relating to stress/tone/intonation (prosodic rules), or to the sound rules applied at a morpheme break (morphophonemic rules), so is predictable to people familiar with the language and it doesnt need to be written. If this is not the case, then there is no way to deduce whether a sequence of consonant letters represents a phonetic CVCV sequence or a phonetic CC consonant unless the reader knows the pronunciation of the word intended.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRetroflex consonants present a particular problem for the Sora Sompeng script. Sora follows the Munda pattern of using dental t and retroflex ɖ, but not retroflex ʈ or dental d (which fill out the Brahmic pattern). Retroflex loan sounds (including ʈ, ʂ and ɳ) are indicated by writing the one Sora Sompeng diacritic, \u003cspan class=Em\u003emae\u003c/span\u003e, to the left of the closest equivalent letter. Dental d is not differentiated from retroflex ɖ in writing. Retroflex ɽ is also native to the Sora language, and is written using the letters \u003cspan class=Em\u003er+d\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAspirate stops are also problematic for Sora Sompeng writing. Aspiration is not distinctive in native Sora, so is omitted in writing Sora words, but needs to be represented in writing a number of loan words from neighbouring languages in which it is distinctive. The letter \u003cspan class=Em\u003eh\u003c/span\u003e cannot be used to indicate aspiration; it is used for representing a glottal stop. Nouns in Sora must have two syllables, and a glottal stop is often inserted halfway through the vowel in a mono-syllabic noun to split it into two syllables. Therefore, where aspiration needs to be written, it is written with the closest non-aspirate letter followed by the letter \u003cspan class=Em\u003ej\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt is thought that vowel length is generally not written. The exception to this is in cases where a long a: at the start of a word conveys some kind of grammatical information about the word, or in cases where it changes the stress pattern of the word. In these cases the letter \u003cspan class=Em\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e is written twice.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVowel nasalization is distinctive in spoken Sora, but it is not clear whether this is represented in the writing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSora Sompeng has no script-specific punctuation.

From this time until the early 20th century, Telugu was a literary language - the written form reflected an archaic spoken form. Modern standard Telugu only began to be written during the second half of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLike most of the Brahmic-derived scripts, Telugu is an abugida written from left to right. Visually, it differs from many of the North Indian scripts in that the letters have a rounded base and the characteristic North Indic headstroke has been replaced by a hook on the top left of each letter. An inherent a vowel is inherent in each of the thirty-two consonant symbols. Vowels other than a are written using diacritics attached above, below or to the right of the consonant symbol. These vowel diacritics override the inherent vowel so that the syllable is read with the correct vowel sound. Where a vowel occurs at the start of a word, there is no preceding consonant symbol to which a diacritic may be attached, so one of sixteen independent vowel letters is used. (Two of these letters do not, strictly speaking, represent vowels, but long and short forms of the syllabic consonants r̩ and l̩.) A \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehalantamu\u003c/span\u003e symbol is written above a word-final consonant to silence the inherent vowel. This symbol can also be used for writing consonant clusters, when a ligature (described below) is not used.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSpoken Telugu contains a number of \u003ca href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?\u0026cat_id=Glossary#gemination target=_blank\u003e\u003cimg src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png /\u003e\u0026nbsp;geminates\u003c/a\u003e (long consonants).

The first is \u003cspan class=Em\u003eanusvara\u003c/span\u003e, a circle which either represents a nasal consonant pronounced at the same place in the oral cavity as the following consonant, or, where there is not following consonant, represents a final m. For example, the word ʌŋgəmu limb of the body is written with \u003cspan class=Em\u003eanusvara\u003c/span\u003e following the ʌ and the word lʌga:m bridle with \u003cspan class=Em\u003eanusvara\u003c/span\u003e following the a:, although there are separate letters for representing the sounds ŋ and m. The second symbol is \u003cspan class=Em\u003evisarga\u003c/span\u003e, two small circles stacked in the manner of the dots in a Latin colon. This symbol is transcribed as ḥ and normally represents a post-vocalic ha, as in the word again written \u003cspan class=Em\u003epunaḥ\u003c/span\u003e and pronounced punəha.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/wm/d9/wmd9w5645d_TeluguVIS.png height=113 width=386 /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTelugu writing employs a script-specific set of digits from 0-9.

It was used to write the Tagalog language, which is still spoken by 21 million people throughout the Philippines, although it is now written in the Latin script. The Tagalog script was an abugida which descended from the Oldl Kawi, and ultimately the Brahmic, scripts. Each of the 14 consonants contained an inherent a vowel, with other vowels being represented by means of diacritical marks placed above or below the syllable. There are also 3 vowel characters to represent syllable-initial vowels. Only V and CV syllables could be represented in the orthography, although spoken Tagalog also employed VC and CVC syllables. In words taking one of the latter forms, the correct interpretation was inferred through context. In the 1600s, Spanish missionaries translating books into the language struggled with their inability to write final consonants, so a virama character was created to accommodate these in the orthography. This was met with mixed feelings; many Tagalog felt that such a reform corrupted the language, and used the virama only when writing Spanish words. The only punctuation mark was a line, or pair of lines, which served the roles approximately equivalent to the Latin comma or full stop, or separated sets of words.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTraditionally, Tagalog was written without a break between words, vertically from bottom to top and left to right.

The result was that text published by the Spanish in the Tagalog script were written in horizontal lines to be read from left to right, with each character and its diacritics being rotated by 90 degrees Kuipers p5. The first book to be printed in the horizontal script was the Doctrina Christiana in 1593.

The exact origin of the script is not clear; Tibetan Buddhism traditionally ascribes its creation to Minister Thon mi Sambhota in Northeast India, but Bon Po religious tradition cites Iranian or Central Asian origins. What is generally agreed upon is that it is ultimately derived from the Brahmi script, as evidenced by its syllabic structure, its use of diacritics to modify the vowel in a syllable, and its typically Brahmic canonical arrangement of the letters in phonological groups.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are a number of different styles of writing Tibetan, which can be grouped into two main variants: \u003cspan class=Em\u003edbu-can\u003c/span\u003e with a head, which is the most commonly used and is the less cursive of the two, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003edbu-med\u003c/span\u003e headless which includes the relatively careful \u003cspan class=Em\u003edpe-yig\u003c/span\u003e book writing or the rapid \u003cspan class=Em\u003enkhyug-yig\u003c/span\u003e running writing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTibetan is written from left to right. It is an abugida; there is an inherent a in each of the thirty consonant letters, also called radicals. Unlike many Brahmic abugidas, a consonant without a vowel is not represented by means of a \u003cspan class=Em\u003evirama\u003c/span\u003e diacritic, rather, every radical is written by default with a dot to the upper right, which is removed when there is no vowel intended. For example ད་ represents da but ད represents d.

These are written using the letter for the closest Tibetan equivalent, flipped horizontally, so ཏ represents ta and ཊ represents ʈa.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe relationship between spoken and written Tibetan is complex and a number of unpronounced consonants are written in Tibetan. These may reflect older pronunciations of the language or simply be spelling conventions to distinguish between words which sound the same. Spoken Tibetan is largely monosyllabic with very few consonant clusters in native words. However, in the written form up to seven symbols - six consonants and a vowel - can be used to represent a simple CVC syllable as in the form written \u003cspan class=Em\u003eb+s+g+r+u+b+s\u003c/span\u003e but pronounced ɖùp, meaning completed. There are certain rules dictating the way in which letters can be combined. A full radical is central to a cluster; to this may be combined a prescript consonant to the left, one vowel, a superscript consonant above, a subscript consonant below, one vowel, either super- or subscript, and up to two postscript consonants to the right. Further rules govern which consonants can appear where in the cluster: the consonants \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003el\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003es\u003c/span\u003e can be stacked above a radical, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ey\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003el\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ew\u003c/span\u003e can be stacked below.

Upon waking, he wrote these symbols down.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eAn alternative theory proposes that the Vai syllabary was influenced by the Cherokee syllabary, to which it bears remarkable similarities. After the creation of the Cherokee syllabary in the early 1800s a number of Cherokee emigrated to West Africa. One particular Cherokee man, Austin Curtis, married into an influential family and became a chief himself. It is proposed that he might have contributed to the creation of the Vai script and influenced its form.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn the 1960s Momolu Massaquoi at the University of Liberia proposed further minor modifications to some characters, to enable every legitimate syllable to be represented, and, largely as a result of his efforts and those of August Klingenheben, in 1962 the script was standardised.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script comprises 212 symbols, with every syllable in use being represented by a unique character. Forty or fifty of these characters are in much wider use than the others; many literates in fact find fifty characters adequate for their purposes. Although some glyphs representing a common place of articulation are related, there is no referable derivation of form or predictable application of diacritics. Tone is not represented, although Vai is a tonal language.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script is a moraic syllabary. That is to say, rather then each symbol expressing one syllable, each symbol expresses one mora. The spoken language adheres to a strict (C)V(N) pattern, and the script reflects this. CV syllables containing a short vowel are monomoraic and written with a single character, and those containing a long vowel or diphthong are bimoraic and written with two characters. Closed CVN syllables are also bimoraic and written with two characters, as the nasal itself constitutes a mora. It should be mentioned that there is some variation in the way long vowels and diphthongs are syllabified, and therefore written/spelled.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eVai is written from left to right, but it is suggested that at one time it was also written from right to left or vertically from top to bottom. Vai-style numerals were proposed in the 1920s, but these were not popular and have never been widely attested. The 1962 Standard used a system of Vai punctuation, which is still used, but in combination with Latin punctuation according to personal preference. Older texts also attest to a set of logograms, although only two of these are still in use. Texts are currently published with breaks between words.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBukɛlɛ established schools throughout the Vai-speaking region to propagate his script, and literacy became widespread; by 1899 most of the Vai were said to be literate. During the C20th a lengthy manuscript was published, detailing clan histories, Biblical and Quranic translations, and folktales. There continues to be a market for Vai literature; The Institute for Liberian Languages publishes in the script.

The letters are arranged in rows and columns according to their phonetic properties; from top to bottom: velars, palatals, retroflex, dentals, labials, and from left to right: nasals, voiceless stops, voiced stops. There is no distinction made between aspirated and non-aspirated stops, either in speech or writing. Some letters appear to be redundant, for example the retroflex ʂ is not used in speech but there is a letter to represent it in writing. The names of the letters are written using consonant clusters, but pronounced in CVC form, for example \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehl\u003c/span\u003e which is pronounced hol. Both of these features are thought by some scholars to be attempts by Bodra to sanskritize the script.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWarang Citi is written from left to right. Consonants contain an inherent vowel; this is normally transcribed \u003cspan class=Em\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e but can be pronounced variously as a, o, e or ə.
