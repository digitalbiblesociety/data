It is used for writing the Zhang-zhung language, now preserved only in Bön literature, and occasionally for writing Tibetan. This script is not to be confused with the \u003cspan class=Em\u003eMarchung\u003c/span\u003e script, a related but separate script about which little is known beyond that it has been used in some other Bön texts.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMarchen writing employs similar principles to \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Tibt\u003eTibetan\u003c/a\u003e; each consonant has a base form and a subjoined form which can be combined in vertical stacks to represent consonant clusters. There are also five vowel signs which can be attached to a base consonant or to a consonant stack; in the absence of one of these signs, consonants have an inherent /a/ vowel.\u003c/p\u003e ","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":[]}
