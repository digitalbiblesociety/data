Proto-Elamite is the oldest of the three, and was used between 3100-2900 BC. It has not been deciphered but consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly logographic. The other two writing systems in Elam were Linear Elamite and Elamite Cuneiform.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
