Visually it resembles Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform; most of the letters are arrangements of between two and five horizontal, vertical or angle-shaped wedges. However, there appears to be no derivational relationship between the sound-to-symbol mapping of individual letters in the two scripts, nor has any other script been found which links the forms of the scripts. For this reason, Old Persian cuneiform is generally believed to have been an independent invention.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOld Persian was written from left to right and encoded three vowel (a/a:, i/i: and u/u:) and twenty-two consonant sounds using three vowel and thirty-three consonant letters. Vowel length was generally not indicated; the exception to this was a long a: vowel. All vowels except for short a were written, so the script was essentially an alphabet, with some syllabic properties.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe twenty-two consonant signs were of two types. For thirteen consonant sounds, the following vowel sound was represented by the following vowel sign (or lack thereof). These consonants contained an inherent short a vowel; when this vowel was missing its absence was not indicated in any way. So \u003cspan class=Em\u003ep\u003c/span\u003e = p or pa. When the letter was followed by an \u003cspan class=Em\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e letter, it indicated a long a: vowel: \u003cspan class=Em\u003ep\u003c/span\u003e+\u003cspan class=Em\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e = pa: but \u003cspan class=Em\u003ep\u003c/span\u003e+\u003cspan class=Em\u003ei\u003c/span\u003e = pi or pi: and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ep\u003c/span\u003e+\u003cspan class=Em\u003eu\u003c/span\u003e = pu or pu:. The remaining nine consonant sounds each had a different shape depending on the quality of the following vowel. Of these, only d and m had three different forms to represent -a/a:/Ã˜, -i/i: and -u/u:. The remaining seven letters only had a two-way distinction, either to distinguish -u/u: from -a/a:/i/i:, or because only two of the three vowels were ever used after that particular consonant.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor those nine signs whose shape already implies the following vowel, the vowel was still written as a separate letter. So the sound di/i: was written with two letters \u003cspan class=Em\u003edi\u003c/span\u003e+\u003cspan class=Em\u003ei\u003c/span\u003e. This enabled diphthongs following one of these nine consonants to be easily expressed; \u003cspan class=Em\u003eda\u003c/span\u003e+\u003cspan class=Em\u003ei\u003c/span\u003e represented dai. Diphthongs following one of the other thirteen consonants were a little more ambiguous; the letters \u003cspan class=Em\u003ep\u003c/span\u003e+\u003cspan class=Em\u003ei\u003c/span\u003e could represent either pi/i: or pai because of the possible inherent a vowel.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome letters were subject to further orthographic rules; \u003cspan class=Em\u003en\u003c/span\u003e and (before stops) \u003cspan class=Em\u003em\u003c/span\u003e were not written at the end of a syllable, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003eh\u003c/span\u003e was not written before \u003cspan class=Em\u003eu\u003c/span\u003e or \u003cspan class=Em\u003em\u003c/span\u003e. The vowel \u003cspan class=Em\u003ei\u003c/span\u003e was generally not written after \u003cspan class=Em\u003eh\u003c/span\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn addition to the thirty-six phonetic letters, seven ideograms were used to represent common words or divine names, and there was a set of base numbers representing 1, 2, 10, 20, 100. These were added cumulatively with the biggest numbers to the left to represent other numbers, for example 5=2+2+1, 13=10+2+1, 60=20+20+20 etc.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["peo"]}
