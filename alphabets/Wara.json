The history of the script is controversial. Followers of Lako Bodra, an influential community leader who is variously credited with the invention or the rediscovery of the script, claim a much older heritage for the script than scholars have evidence for. The script displays a number of similarities with other scripts including Latin and Brahmi; Bodras followers claim that this is the result of borrowing <span class=Em>from</span> Varang Kshiti but scholars generally believe it is the result of borrowing <span class=Em>into</span> it. The version of the script which has been most well-documented is based on an archaic (perhaps secret shamanistic) dialect of Ho called Ho Hayam, not the more widely-spoken dialect, Ho Kaji.</p> <p>There are thirty-one letters in the script, twenty-one consonants and ten vowels, each of which also has a cursive form. The letters are arranged in rows and columns according to their phonetic properties; from top to bottom: velars, palatals, retroflex, dentals, labials, and from left to right: nasals, voiceless stops, voiced stops. There is no distinction made between aspirated and non-aspirated stops, either in speech or writing. Some letters appear to be redundant, for example the retroflex ʂ is not used in speech but there is a letter to represent it in writing. The names of the letters are written using consonant clusters, but pronounced in CVC form, for example <span class=Em>hl</span> which is pronounced hol. Both of these features are thought by some scholars to be attempts by Bodra to sanskritize the script.</p> <p>Warang Citi is written from left to right. Consonants contain an inherent vowel; this is normally transcribed <span class=Em>a</span> but can be pronounced variously as a, o, e or ə. Vowels other than the inherent vowel are written to the right of a preceding consonant using one of ten independent vowel letters. Unlike many of the South Asian abugidas, vowel diacritics are not used. One of the vowel letters corresponds to the Devanagari <span class=Em>anusvara</span> diacritic, marking nasalization. Two vowel letters, <span class=Em>i</span> and <span class=Em>u</span>, have long counterparts but apart from these, vowel length is indicated by writing the letter <span class=Em>h</span> after the vowel.</p> <p>The Ho language employs two preglottalized stops, b and ḍ in word-final position. Preglottalization is not marked in writing, which leads to some ambiguity in loan words which have retained their native phonology and in which final b and ḍ are not glottal. Some ambiguity also arises in the case of consonant clusters. Ligated conjunct letters are not used, nor is any <span class=Em>virama</span> for killing the inherent vowel, so there is no way of knowing whether a written sequence of consonant letters represents a CVC(V) string or a CC(V) cluster, without knowing the word.</p> <p>The sequence <span class=Em>hb</span> represents either b or v, often transliterated <span class=Em>w</span>. b can also be written with the letter <span class=Em>b</span>; the reason for having an alternative representation is unknown. It is possible that the use of <span class=Em>hb</span> marks the word as sacred semantically rather than (or as well as) conveying phonological information. It is also possible that it reflects archaic pronunciation of some words.</p> <p>There is a set of script-specific Warang Citi numerals from 0-9, and for multiples of 10 up to 100. These are not always used consistently however; the number 23 for example can be written either with the characters <span class=Em>20</span> and <span class=Em>3</span> or with <span class=Em>2</span> and <span class=Em>3</span>.</p>","fonts":[]}
