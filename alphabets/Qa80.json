It was used in the Yaeyama islands and the island of Yonaguni, both of which are today part of Japan. The script dates to at least the late 19th century. Today it is found in folk art, and items such as tee-shirts. </p> <p>There are different types of characters in Kaida writing. The pictographic glyphs themselves are referred to as <span class=Em>kaida-di</span>. Not all of these glyphs are arbitrary, as some were designed to look like their referent, while others were not. Characters for numbers and indicators of the month and day bear a strong resemblance to the <span class=Em>kanji</span> characters of China and Japan. In addition, there are six characters, called <span class=Em>sūchūma</span>, used to represent different volume measurements. These characters not only represent volume, but can also be used to express numerical values. Kaida also makes use of several dots, although their significance is still yet to be determined. Lastly, there are symbols, called <span class=Em>dahan</span>, which indicate individual families. </p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
