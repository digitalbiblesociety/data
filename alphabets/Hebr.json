It is also used for writing some varieties of Arabic spoken in North Africa, Iraq and Yemen; the languages of the Jewish communities in Italy and Corfu, Morocco (Berber), Spain and the Caucasus mountains; and the modern Jewish Aramaic languages. Prior to 500 BC the Hebrew language was written in the Paleo-Hebrew script, which was abandoned after the Jewish exile in the 5th century BC in favour of the Aramaic script, from which the current Hebrew script descended. It is commonly called the Hebrew alphabet, after its first two letters \u003cspan class=Em\u003ealeph\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ebet\u003c/span\u003e, although it is actually an abjad.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHebrew is a unicameral script; there is only one case. It is written from right to left. The script contains twenty-two consonant letters, five of which take a variant form when used at the end of a word. Vowels are normally omitted when writing the Hebrew language, but four of the consonant letters א \u003cspan class=Em\u003ealeph\u003c/span\u003e, ה \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehe\u003c/span\u003e, ו \u003cspan class=Em\u003ewaw\u003c/span\u003e and י \u003cspan class=Em\u003eyod\u003c/span\u003e can be used for representing a number of (normally long) vowels when it is necessary to disambiguate between similar words. Until the 9th century, these letters, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003emater lectionis\u003c/span\u003e were the only means for representing vowels; later a system of diacritics, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eniqqud\u003c/span\u003e was introduced with the potential for fully representing long and short vowels in every word. Niqqud is rarely used outside of childrens books, poetry, and books for teaching the Hebrew language. When writing the Yiddish language, vowels are fully expressed by means of a system derived but different from Hebrew vocalic representation (see Yiddish Orthography).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eA number of cantillation marks are used in the scriptural scrolls (\u003cspan class=Em\u003eTanakh\u003c/span\u003e) to indicate the rhythm and stress pattern for chanting the text aloud.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eOne ligature is commonly used in writing the Hebrew language, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ealef lamed\u003c/span\u003e ﭏ. Four additional ligatures are used for writing Yiddish. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003etetragrammaton\u003c/span\u003e is also considered by many to be a ligature. It represents one of a number of sacred words which are not permitted to be written, so are represented by means of another symbol or set of symbols. The tetragarammaton does not refer to one specific symbol, but to any of a number of symbols representing the Hebrew word for God, composed of the letters J H W and H. Some Hebrew scribes use a ligature in place of any combination of these four letters, even when they appear within a different, secular word.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePunctuation in the Hebrew script is much the same as in the Latin script, with the exception of a script-specific hyphen \u003cspan class=Em\u003emaqaf\u003c/span\u003e, colon \u003cspan class=Em\u003esof pasuq\u003c/span\u003e, forward/vertical slash \u003cspan class=Em\u003epaseq\u003c/span\u003e, abbreviation mark \u003cspan class=Em\u003egeresh\u003c/span\u003e, and a mark \u003cspan class=Em\u003egershayim\u003c/span\u003e to indicate that a word is an acronym.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHebrew writing for the most part uses Latin numbers, although a system used to be in much more common use which assigned a numerical value of units, tens, or hundreds to each letter in the script inventory; the letters could then be added together to create any number. In modern texts this system is only used for the Hebrew calendar and other special cases.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are four main styles of writing the Hebrew language. \u003cspan class=Em\u003eAshuri\u003c/span\u003e is a widely-used block style. A particular form of Ashuri, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eSTA\\\\\\M\u003c/span\u003e (an acronym for the Hebrew words for which this style is used)","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["jrb","heb","jpr","sam","yid"]}
