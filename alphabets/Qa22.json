This religion is a complex combination of local Kurdish beliefs and Islamic Sufi doctrine. Religious documents can be written in Kurdish or in Arabic; the Yezidi script is used for both languages.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYezidi is an abjad; vowels are generally not written. However, it is unclear whether it constitutes a script proper, or if it is a cipher.
