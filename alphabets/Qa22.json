This religion is a complex combination of local Kurdish beliefs and Islamic Sufi doctrine. Religious documents can be written in Kurdish or in Arabic; the Yezidi script is used for both languages.</p> <p>Yezidi is an abjad; vowels are generally not written. However, it is unclear whether it constitutes a script proper, or if it is a cipher. It is thought to be based in part on the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Arab>Arabic</a> script and partly on the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Latn>Latin</a> script.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
