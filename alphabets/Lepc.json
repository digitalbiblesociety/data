It is used for writing the Lepcha language, a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by about 52,800 people in India, Nepal and Bhutan. The script is derived from Tibetan writing, probably motivated by Buddhist missionary activity in the 1700s. Early manuscripts were written in vertical columns but later and current texts are written horizontally. Many letters, when rotated back to their previous vertical position, closely resemble their Tibetan counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script comprises twenty-nine basic CV letters, called mother letters, where V is a, and nine vowel diacritics, called child letters, which are used to represent post-consonantal vowels other than a. There are also three letters which have been added since the late 1990s for representing the retroflex consonants ʈ, ʈ\u003csup\u003eh\u003c/sup\u003e, ɖ; these letters are used only in Sikkim, India. Elsewhere these sounds are written with the \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekra\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehra\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003egra\u003c/span\u003e ligatures modified by \u003cspan class=Em\u003enukta\u003c/span\u003e - a dot written below the letter. Any consonant can be used at the start of a syllable, and any vowel at the end, but only k, t, n, p, m, r, l can be used at the end. Final forms exist for representing these seven sounds syllable-finally; these are diacritics written above the base letter. Syllable-initial vowels are written with a vowel-carrier which represents a when unmarked, or any of the other nine vowels when marked with the appropriate diacritic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThree consonants can be used medially, \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ey\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003el\u003c/span\u003e. Clusters containing medial r or y are written with special ligating forms which attach to the base letter. Ligating forms of \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ey\u003c/span\u003e can also combine to produce a post-consonantal \u003cspan class=Em\u003e-rya\u003c/span\u003e ligature. Clusters with medial l are written using a set of seven letters representing kla, gla, pla, fla, bla, mla, hla. These letters cannot be decomposed into individual C+l parts.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTwo other non-alphabetic signs are used as well as \u003cspan class=Em\u003enukta\u003c/span\u003e. Letters modified with \u003cspan class=Em\u003enukta\u003c/span\u003e are called \u003cspan class=Em\u003enuktated\u003c/span\u003e. The sign called \u003cspan class=Em\u003enyindo\u003c/span\u003e is written to the left of the mother letter to indicate a final velar nasal when no specific vowel is written. So \u003cspan class=Em\u003es\u003c/span\u003e + \u003cspan class=Em\u003enyindo\u003c/span\u003e = saŋ. Where a different vowel is intended, the \u003cspan class=Em\u003elakang\u003c/span\u003e sign is used together with the appropriate vowel diacritic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eLepcha writing uses script-specific digits from 0-9, and, when copying traditional texts, five punctuation marks. In modern texts, Latin punctuation is normally used, together with the Tibetan \u003cspan class=Em\u003etsheg\u003c/span\u003e symbol.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["lep"]}
