It was used in the 1930s and early 1940s around Gbili’s local area for sending messages, keeping tax and store records, and recording legal debts, but by the late 1940s had been replaced by the Latin script.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eKpelle writing uses 88 symbols, each representing a pair of syllables dubbed ‘mutational pairs’ by the linguist David Dalby. These pairs are related by the phonological similarity of their initial consonants or consonant clusters. For example, the syllables \u003cspan class=Em\u003ekpi\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003egbi\u003c/span\u003e are identical except in voicing, and are represented by a single symbol. Some pairs are written with two symbols, for example, \u003cspan class=Em\u003eti\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003edi\u003c/span\u003e, but either symbol can be used for either sound.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script is written from left to right, without the use of punctuation. Numbers from 1-10 can be written, but there is no symbol for writing the number zero.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":[]}
