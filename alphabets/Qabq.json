It was developed over approximately 40 years by Yogesh Raj Kadasoley, and officially released in 2012. The script is designed for writing the Badaga language, a Dravidian language spoken in Tamil Nadu in South India. The Badaga people primarily worship the Hindu goddess Hethai.</p> <p>Previously, the language was written in the Kannada script, and it is currently most often written in the Tamil script. </p> <p>This is not the first script designed exclusively for the Badaga language. In 2009, Anandhan Raju designed a Badaga script based on the shapes of Tamil characters.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
