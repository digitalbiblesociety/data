The script was developed from Aramaic writing, and was the immediate precursor of Arabic writing.</p> <p>Nabatean was a right-to-left abjad; each letter represented a consonant and the reader had to supply the vowels from the context. It was a cursive script which made extensive use of ligatures. The script was used over a wide geographic area, and letter shapes were highly diverse from one region to another.</p>","fonts":[]}
