The script is used to write the Gondi language and is distinct from the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Gonm\u003eMasaram Gondi\u003c/a\u003e script designed in 1928 by Munshi Mangal Singh Masaram.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGunjala Gondi manuscripts have been dated to 1750 and reference events as early as the 6th and 7th centuries. The script is cursive, hand-written sources showing syllables of a word connected using pen strokes. It does not appear to be genetically related to other scripts, although it strongly resembles the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Modi\u003eModi\u003c/a\u003e script in appearance and style. Whilst the vowel order follows the Brahmi pattern, the consonant order does not, starting with \u003cspan class=Em\u003eya\u003c/span\u003e, rather than the usual \u003cspan class=Em\u003eka\u003c/span\u003e. Vowel signs and modifiers are placed to the right of the consonant or above the head-stroke at the right edge.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eGunjala Gondi is currently undergoing something of a revival. Professor Jayadhir Tirumal Rao, who has researched the script is quoted as saying:“Andhra Pradesh has 34 tribal communities and none of them has a script except the Gondi community. The script is their self-esteem and we took up the task of preserving it by reviving the language.”. Teaching materials have been developed in the script and it is being taught in a number of schools in villages with a high Gond population.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["wsg"]}
