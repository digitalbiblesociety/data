Naxi has also been written in the Latin and, more famously, the Dongba scripts.</p> <p>Nakhi Geba is thought to have been developed around 1200-1250 AD but was never widely used; its primary use was the transcription of religious mantras. There are few remaining texts in the script, and little is known about it. It was a syllabary, and the shapes of the letters appear to have been variously based on Chinese and Dongba characters, with some original designs. </p>","fonts":[]}
