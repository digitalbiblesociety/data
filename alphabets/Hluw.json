The script has also been called ‘Hittite Hieroglyphs’ as it was once thought that they had been used for writing the Hittite language; however we now know that was not the case.</p> <p>There are approximately five hundred signs attested in inscriptions on stone and lead. These have both syllabic and logographic components. Words could be written entirely with logographs (in particular at the earlier period), or with phonetic complements in a variety of configurations.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
