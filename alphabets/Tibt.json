It is also used for transcribing religious Sanskrit texts. The exact origin of the script is not clear; Tibetan Buddhism traditionally ascribes its creation to Minister Thon mi Sambhota in Northeast India, but Bon Po religious tradition cites Iranian or Central Asian origins. What is generally agreed upon is that it is ultimately derived from the Brahmi script, as evidenced by its syllabic structure, its use of diacritics to modify the vowel in a syllable, and its typically Brahmic canonical arrangement of the letters in phonological groups.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere are a number of different styles of writing Tibetan, which can be grouped into two main variants: \u003cspan class=Em\u003edbu-can\u003c/span\u003e with a head, which is the most commonly used and is the less cursive of the two, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003edbu-med\u003c/span\u003e headless which includes the relatively careful \u003cspan class=Em\u003edpe-yig\u003c/span\u003e book writing or the rapid \u003cspan class=Em\u003enkhyug-yig\u003c/span\u003e running writing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTibetan is written from left to right. It is an abugida; there is an inherent a in each of the thirty consonant letters, also called radicals. Unlike many Brahmic abugidas, a consonant without a vowel is not represented by means of a \u003cspan class=Em\u003evirama\u003c/span\u003e diacritic, rather, every radical is written by default with a dot to the upper right, which is removed when there is no vowel intended. For example ད་ represents da but ད represents d. The inherent vowel can be modified using one of four vowel diacritics, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ei\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003eu\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003ee\u003c/span\u003e or \u003cspan class=Em\u003eo\u003c/span\u003e. Vowels are rarely written at the beginning of a native syllable, and there is only one independent vowel letter, ཨ \u003cspan class=Em\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e, to which can be added the same vowel diacritics to represent other syllable-initial vowels.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRetroflex consonants are only present in loan words from Sanskrit. These are written using the letter for the closest Tibetan equivalent, flipped horizontally, so ཏ represents ta and ཊ represents ʈa.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe relationship between spoken and written Tibetan is complex and a number of unpronounced consonants are written in Tibetan. These may reflect older pronunciations of the language or simply be spelling conventions to distinguish between words which sound the same. Spoken Tibetan is largely monosyllabic with very few consonant clusters in native words. However, in the written form up to seven symbols - six consonants and a vowel - can be used to represent a simple CVC syllable as in the form written \u003cspan class=Em\u003eb+s+g+r+u+b+s\u003c/span\u003e but pronounced ɖùp, meaning completed. There are certain rules dictating the way in which letters can be combined. A full radical is central to a cluster; to this may be combined a prescript consonant to the left, one vowel, a superscript consonant above, a subscript consonant below, one vowel, either super- or subscript, and up to two postscript consonants to the right. Further rules govern which consonants can appear where in the cluster: the consonants \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003el\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003es\u003c/span\u003e can be stacked above a radical, and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ey\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e, \u003cspan class=Em\u003el\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ew\u003c/span\u003e can be stacked below. For example, the cluster kra is written with with \u003cspan class=Em\u003eka\u003c/span\u003e as the base radical, with \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e stacked below it. But rka is written with \u003cspan class=Em\u003eka\u003c/span\u003e as the base radical, with \u003cspan class=Em\u003er\u003c/span\u003e stacked above it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/uh/3c/uh3ccghszt_Tibetan.png.jpg height=146 width=150 /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn written Tibetan, syllables have been separated by a \u003cspan class=Em\u003etsheg\u003c/span\u003e ་ since the 10th century. Note that syllable here refers to a written consonant/consonant cluster with all of its prefixes, suffixes and vowel signs, not necessarily a syllable in the phonetic sense. Spaces are not used to separate words, however, since many words are mono-syllabic the \u003cspan class=Em\u003etsheg\u003c/span\u003e often functions as a word separator also. One grammatical punctuation mark is used, a vertical line called \u003cspan class=Em\u003eshad\u003c/span\u003e which is used to divide sections of text. There are three official variants of this symbol, plus many other stylistic variants. A hooked \u003cspan class=Em\u003eshad\u003c/span\u003e is used where, grammatically, a break is required, but the writer intended continuous recitation. There are also a number of astrological, editorial, tantric, and cantillation marks, further details of which can be found in \u003ca href=www.tibet.dk/pktc/download/TD_Tib_Signs3.pdf\u003e this article\u003c/a\u003e. Four additional punctuation marks are used when writing the Dzongkha language.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Tibetan script contains signs for numbers 0-9, and a set of half-numbers, the digits 0-9 with a hooked slash through them. Very little is known about the intended usage of these half-numbers. Some scholars claim that the slashed digit represents one-half less than the unslashed digit (that is, slashed 4 represents 3.5), but others maintain that they were originally used to indicate proportions in Tibetan art, in such a way that a slashed digit represented one-half of its unslashed equivalent.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["bft","dzo","taj","tdg","bod","tsj","adx","adi","bro","sgt","kjz","tgf","cna","cgk","cvg","xct","dka","dre","dzl","bfu","goe","hut","jda","jya","kkf","kbg","khg","xkf","ght","xkz","lbj","lkh","lya","lep","loy","luk","mon","muk","kte","npb","neh","nmm","otb","ole","lae","prx","xsr","sip","spt","sbu","tcn","lbf","ola","clk","zau"]}
