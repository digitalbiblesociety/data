It is also used in Orissa for transcribing Sanskrit texts. The earliest inscriptions in the Odia language have been dated to 1051 AD, written in the Kalinga script from which modern Odia writing is derived.</p> <p>Like the other Brahmic scripts used in India, the Odia script is written from left to right and is based on the orthographic syllable called <span class=Em>akṣara</span>. An <span class=Em>akṣara</span> represents either a lone vowel or a consonant with a vowel attached. Each vowel sound can be written with one of two letters; used at the beginning of a word it is written with an independent vowel letter, but when it follows a consonant it is written with a dependent vowel diacritic which attaches above, below, beside or flanking both sides of the consonant letter. Consonant letters inherently contain a following ɔ vowel (transcribed <span class=Em>a</span>) unless they are modified with a vowel diacritic indicating a different vowel, or a <span class=Em>halanta</span> symbol silencing the vowel entirely.</p> <p>Consonant clusters can be written in several ways. Some combinations use a special non-decomposable ligature, or <span class=Em>conjunct</span>, for example <span class=Em>jnya</span>. Others are written using the <span class=Em>halanta</span> symbol to silence the vowel in the first member of the cluster. Alternatively, clusters can be written using half- or joining forms of all but one letter in the cluster. In some cases the first member is reduced to a half-form and attached to the second, for example in the cluster <span class=Em>dbha</span>; in other cases the second member is reduced and attached to the first, as in <span class=Em>dgha</span>. The orthographic syllable does not necessarily correspond to the phonological syllable in words containing consonant clusters.</p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/ew/p9/ewp9cjrm6j_OriyaConjuncts.png height=124 width=400 /></p> <p>Ligatures composed of an independent vowel and a consonant are generally not used, with the exception of the letter <span class=Em>wa</span> which is a combination of <span class=Em>o</span> and <span class=Em>ba</span> and is sometimes used for writing the sound w in loan words.</p> <p>The script is largely phonetic, that is, the pronunciation of a word can be deduced from its spelling, but there are a few phonological processes that alter the sound of a written letter. For example, the letters <span class=Em>da</span> and <span class=Em>d<sup>h</sup>a</span> are pronounced as ɽ ɽ<sup>h</sup> respectively when used between two vowels. A subscript dot is often written below the letter to indicate this change. So the word Odia is written <span class=Em>o</span> + (<span class=Em>da</span> + <span class=Em>dot</span> + <span class=Em>i diacritic</span>) + <span class=Em>a</span>.</p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/ew/p9/ewp9cjrm6j_OriyaOriya.png height=49 width=85 /></p> <p>As with many of the Brahmic scripts, the <span class=Em>anusvara</span> symbol can be used to indicate a nasal pronounced at the same place of articulation as the following stop, as in the cluster ŋkɔ, when written <span class=Em>anusvara</span> + <span class=Em>ka</span>. However, these clusters can also be written using special conjunct letters; a distinct letter also exists for representing the sound ŋkɔ.</p> <p>There is one script-specific punctuation mark, <span class=Em>isshar</span>, which is used before the name of a person who is deceased.</p>","fonts":[]}
