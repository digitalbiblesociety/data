The language has variously been written in the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Qaab\u003eBalti\u003c/a\u003e (sometimes called Balti-A to distinguish it from Balti-B), \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Tibt\u003eTibetan\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Arab\u003eArabic\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Deva\u003eDevanagari\u003c/a\u003e scripts, reflecting the multi-ethnic makeup and eventful political history of the region.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Balti-B script is currently only known to be attested in one manuscript, “\u003cspan class=Em\u003eThe Story of the Creation of Shigar\u003c/span\u003e”. This was written by the grandson of the man believed to have created the script, known only as Farhat. Some scholars believe that the existence of this manuscript is evidence of a Balti historic literary tradition, all other records of which have been lost. If this is the case, it is likely that there is, or was, also an indigenous name for the script; “Balti-B” is proposed as a tentative name until that is discovered.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script is written from left to right. It is an abugida, with each consonant letter representing a consonant+vowel syllable. By default, this vowel is /a/, but it can be modified with the addition of dependant vowel diacritics. There are 30 consonant letters and 4 vowel diacritics. There is also a “vowel carrier” letter which is used for writing independent vowels (e.g. a vowel at the beginning of a word where there is no preceding consonant to which it can attach). By default this letter represents /a/, but it can also take any of the 4 vowel diacritics in order to represent the other vowels independently. Unlike in other abugidas in this region, there are no conjunct forms for writing consonant clusters; rather, all consonant clusters are written with a \u003ca href=page.php?item_id=glossary#virama\u003evirama\u003c/a\u003e. A set of digits from 0-9 is also used.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=Em\u003eThis script is not currently recognized by \u003ca href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank\u003e\u003cimg src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png /\u003e\u0026nbsp;ISO 15924\u003c/a\u003e, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
