In the 6th century AD, with the arrival of Christianity to the area, the script was supplanted by Coptic.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere were two forms of the Meroitic script; a hieroglyphic form derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs and a cursive form derived from Demotic Egyptian. The majority of extant texts are written in the cursive script.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script has been deciphered to the point that many texts can be read, but the content not understood, as the language itself is no longer used and little is known about it.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCursive Meroitic was written from right to left. There were fifteen signs for representing consonants, each inherently having the following vowel a. There were also three vowel letters, as well as a letter for representing an initial a sound, and four letters for writing the syllables ne, se, te and to. Some final consonants, including s and n, were not written.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eCursive Meroitic was one of very few scripts from that era which made use of a word separator symbol. This symbol appeared as two dots stacked one on top of the other.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":[]}
