It was designed for writing the Nyanja, Lomwe, Sena, Tonga, Tumbuka, Yao, and Nyakyusa-Ngonde languages, spoken by approximately 15 million people in Malawi and its bordering countries. The script was intended to replace the Latin script for these languages.</p> <p>The character repertoire is usually described as having thirty-two <span class=Em>misisi</span> (syllables containing an <span class=Em>a</span> vowel) and thirty-two corresponding <span class=Em>misiri</span> for each of the vowels <span class=Em>e</span>, <span class=Em>i</span>, <span class=Em>o</span> and <span class=Em>u</span>. The <span class=Em>misiri</span> are visually identical to the <span class=Em>misisi</span> except for an extending mark on the right hand side to indicate which vowel is intended. In addition there are eleven <span class=Em>mituyo</span> (auxiliary symbols which can be attached to a <span class=Em>misisi</span> or <span class=Em>misiri</span> to indicate a change in sound quality or tone).</p> <p>Another way of describing that same character repertoire, perhaps more in keeping with conventional abugida descriptions, is that there are five independent vowels, five dependent vowels, thirty-one base consonants with an inherent <span class=Em>a</span> vowel, and eleven consonant modifiers. Where a vowel is not preceded by a consonant it is represented by an independent vowel sign. Where a vowel is preceded by a consonant it is represented by a base consonant and an attached vowel sign. Where a consonant is subject to a phonological process (for example prenasalization, aspiration, or affrication), a consonant modifier sign is used. Consonant modifiers take the form of both spacing and non-spacing characters. Mwangwego writing uses Latin digits and punctuation.</p> <p>The script is written horizontally from left to right.</p> <p>Although the script is an abugida, it is commonly taught as a syllabary. That is, students learn each <span class=Em>misisi</span> and <span class=Em>misiri</span> as a character in its own right, rather than learning the base consonants and dependent vowel symbols and combining them as needed. However, the proposed Unicode encoding encodes the script using base consonants and combining vowel symbols, in keeping with the encoding method used for other abugidas.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
