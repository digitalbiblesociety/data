Tikamuli is used primarily in Nepal, and <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Qa05>Jenticha</a> is used primarily in Sikkim. In both places, Sunuwar can also be written in the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Deva>Devanagari</a> script.</p> <p>Tikamuli is named after its inventor, Tikaram Mulicha. It is not genetically related to any other scripts, although some letters appear to have been based on the shapes of <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Limb>Limbu</a> and <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Lepc>Lepcha</a> letters.</p> <p>The script is an abugida; every consonant contains an inherent vowel, which can be modified by appending vowel diacritics to the consonant or silenced by adding a <span class=Em>virama</span> below the consonant. There is also one independent vowel letter which represents /É™/. Word-initial vowels are written with this letter and a vowel diacritic if appropriate.</p> <p>Vowel length marks are also used. Any written consonant can carry up to one vowel diacritic and one vowel length mark.</p> <p>Tikamuli uses script-specific digits from 0-9, and Latin punctuation.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
