It was also occasionally used for writing documents in the Hurrian language. Visually, the script resembled Cuneiform, with each letter written as one of a combination of short, linear wedges. However, the forms of the letters appear to have been freely invented; derivational relationships with other cuneiform letters have not been established. The script remained relatively stable in form throughout its use, with no significant changes.</p> <p>Ugaritic was generally written from left to right with a vertical slash dividing words. Rarely, it was also written from right to left. There were thirty letters used, all representing consonants. Three of these, called <span class=Em>aleph</span>, represented a glottal stop, each with a different vowel associated with it. The vowels a, i and u were represented in this way. The letter representing j was also sometimes used as a vowel. Letters were ordered into one of two orders. The \\\\\\Northern Semitic order\\\\\\\" more closely resembles the order of Hebrew and Greek letters","fonts":[]}
