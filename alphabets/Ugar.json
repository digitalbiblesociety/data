It was also occasionally used for writing documents in the Hurrian language. Visually, the script resembled Cuneiform, with each letter written as one of a combination of short, linear wedges. However, the forms of the letters appear to have been freely invented; derivational relationships with other cuneiform letters have not been established. The script remained relatively stable in form throughout its use, with no significant changes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUgaritic was generally written from left to right with a vertical slash dividing words. Rarely, it was also written from right to left. There were thirty letters used, all representing consonants. Three of these, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003ealeph\u003c/span\u003e, represented a glottal stop, each with a different vowel associated with it. The vowels a, i and u were represented in this way. The letter representing j was also sometimes used as a vowel. Letters were ordered into one of two orders.
