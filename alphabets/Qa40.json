The Khotanese people were of Iranian descent and spoke an Indo-Iranian language.</p> <p>Khotan lay along the Silk Road and was the first place outside of China (as China’s borders lay at that time) to begin cultivating silk. It was also a centre for the study and practice of Mahayana Buddhism. As a result, many languages including Chinese, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Tibetan were spoken there. Sanskrit and Prakrit were written in Khotan in a northern form of the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Brah>Brahmi</a> script, called Gupta, from which the Khotanese script descended.</p> <p>Khotanese is an abugida, similar in structure to <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Tibt>Tibetan</a> with which it shares common origins. Characters were made up of a base radical with one or more vowel marks appended to it to change the quality of the following vowel from the “default” or inherent /a/ to either /i/, /u/ or /e/.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
