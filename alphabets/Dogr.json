Independent and initial vowels are written using letters, while dependent vowels are expressed using combining signs. Consonant letters possess the inherent vowel \u003cspan class=Em\u003ea\u003c/span\u003e, which is changed by the attachment of a vowel sign. Consonant clusters are written in various ways, such as with visible \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehalanta\u003c/span\u003e, as an atomic ligature, and with half-forms; \u003cspan class=Em\u003erepha\u003c/span\u003e is attested, but rarely used. There are no formal conventions regarding representation of conjuncts.\u003c/p\u003e ","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":[]}
