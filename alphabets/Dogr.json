Independent and initial vowels are written using letters, while dependent vowels are expressed using combining signs. Consonant letters possess the inherent vowel <span class=Em>a</span>, which is changed by the attachment of a vowel sign. Consonant clusters are written in various ways, such as with visible <span class=Em>halanta</span>, as an atomic ligature, and with half-forms; <span class=Em>repha</span> is attested, but rarely used. There are no formal conventions regarding representation of conjuncts.</p> ","fonts":[]}
