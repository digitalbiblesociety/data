These languages are often known collectively as “Gurung”, although they are not mutually intelligible. Usually, Gurung is written in the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Deva>Devanagari</a> script; however, in recent times, some Gurung-speaking groups have promoted the use of two other scripts, Khema Tamu Phri and <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Qa04>Gurung Khe Phri</a>.</p> <p>Khema Tamu Phri is an abugida. There are twenty-nine consonant letters, each representing a syllable containing a consonant and the vowel /a/. This vowel can be changed by adding one of seven vowel signs to the consonant letter, or silenced by adding a <span class=Em>virama</span> character. Vowels which do not follow a consonant, for example those at the start of a word, are written with one of eight independent vowel letters.</p> <p>Some of the letter shapes are closely modeled on their Devanagari or Tibetan equivalents.</p> <p>It is not known how widely this script is used, and it seems to be a topic of controversy with supporters and opponents among Gurung speakers.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
