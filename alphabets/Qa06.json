Bantawa is generally written in the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Deva\u003eDevanagari\u003c/a\u003e script, and literacy in this writing system is over 50%. Bantawa can also be written in the Khambu Rai script, which was designed for this purpose in the 1980s by Kripasalyan Rai. Khambu Rai is an abugida; every consonant contains an inherent vowel, which can be modified by the use of vowel diacritics. Multiple consonant sounds occuring together in a cluster, with no intervening vowel, may be written with special ligatures. It is unknown to what extent the Khambu Rai script is used.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=Em\u003eThis script is not currently recognized by the \u003ca href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank\u003e\u003cimg src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png /\u003e\u0026nbsp;ISO 15924 standard\u003c/a\u003e, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
