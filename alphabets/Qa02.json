It is one of two African alphabets used for writing the Fula languages spoken in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gambia, Chad, Sierra Leone, Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Sudan, Central African Republic, CÃ´te dIvoire, Ghana, Togo, Liberia, and Gabon. The second of these alphabets is <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Qa01>Fula Dita</a>. The Fula languages are more commonly written with the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Latn>Latin</a> or <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Arab>Arabic</a> scripts (Ajami style) than with either of the two Fula alphabets. Of the two, Fula Dita has been used more widely than Fula Ba.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
