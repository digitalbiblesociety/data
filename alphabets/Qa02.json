It is one of two African alphabets used for writing the Fula languages spoken in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gambia, Chad, Sierra Leone, Benin, Guinea-Bissau, Sudan, Central African Republic, CÃ´te dIvoire, Ghana, Togo, Liberia, and Gabon. The second of these alphabets is \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Qa01\u003eFula Dita\u003c/a\u003e. The Fula languages are more commonly written with the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Latn\u003eLatin\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Arab\u003eArabic\u003c/a\u003e scripts (Ajami style) than with either of the two Fula alphabets.
