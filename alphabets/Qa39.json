The script originated in Java, and as a result is also sometimes called Old Javanese.</p> <p>Kawi was an abugida; consonant characters are read with an inherent vowel. Diacritics are added to the consonant either to suppress the vowel entirely or to change it to a different vowel.</p> <p>The Kawi alphabet developed around the 16th century AD into the current <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Java>Javanese</a> script. This transition was more stylistic than structural; the visual composition of the script changed but the way it worked stayed the same.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
