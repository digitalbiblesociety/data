It is an ancestor of the modern Uyghur language. The language was written using what has been described as an “alphabetized abjad”, with matres lectionis used for indicating both long and short vowels. The Old Uighur script was the prototype for the Mongolian and Manchu scripts.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
