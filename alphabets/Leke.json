Their language, Eastern Pwo Karen, is spoken by 1,050,000 people in Myanmar and Thailand. It is normally written in the Myanmar or Thai scripts, but the Leke use their own script.</p> <p>The Leke script is generally believed to be the earliest Karen script, and a derivation from the Mon-Burmese, although the shapes of the letters have changed significantly over time and are now more angular in form. The Leke people themselves refer to their writing as <span class=Em>li chaw wae</span>, literally, chicken-scratch letters.
