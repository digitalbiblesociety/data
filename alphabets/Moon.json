Moon became blind as an adult, having already learned to read as a child, and most modern users of the script are also those who have become blind after learning to read printed text and are familiar with the shapes of letters.</p> <p>The script consists of raised curves and lines, based on the shapes of the Latin alphabet. Nine basic shapes are rotated to various orientations to produce twenty-six letters. There are also symbols to represent the words <span class=Em>and</span> and <span class=Em>the</span>, and eight punctuation marks.</p> <p>Moon type is not as widely used as Braille, and never became popular outside of the UK. The script is typed using a Moon Writer, which resembles a typewriter but uses a pressure pad to emboss the shapes of letters onto the paper. </p>","fonts":[]}
