Moon became blind as an adult, having already learned to read as a child, and most modern users of the script are also those who have become blind after learning to read printed text and are familiar with the shapes of letters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe script consists of raised curves and lines, based on the shapes of the Latin alphabet. Nine basic shapes are rotated to various orientations to produce twenty-six letters. There are also symbols to represent the words \u003cspan class=Em\u003eand\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ethe\u003c/span\u003e, and eight punctuation marks.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMoon type is not as widely used as Braille, and never became popular outside of the UK. The script is typed using a Moon Writer, which resembles a typewriter but uses a pressure pad to emboss the shapes of letters onto the paper. \u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":[]}
