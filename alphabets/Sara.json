R. R. Tolkien for writing the artificial language, Quenya, which is spoken in the fictional territory of Middle-earth, where many of Tolkienâ€™s novels are set.</p> <p>Sarati is an abugida. Each letter, called a <span class=Em>sarat</span>, represents one phoneme. The script is based on consonants, with vowels written as diacritics. The script can be written in any direction, vertically, horizontally or <a href=page.php?item_id=glossary#boust>boustrophedon</a>, but is most often written vertically from top to bottom.</p> <p>Sarati was created partly to provide a history for the better-known <a href=https://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=script_detail&uid=g23d9a269f>Tengwar</a> script, which is claimed to be the descendant of Sarati.</p>","fonts":[]}
