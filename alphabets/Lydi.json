Twenty-six sounds were represented in the script, some by more than one letter.</p> <p>Early examples of Lydian writing are written both from left to right and from right to left. One is written in <a href=page.php?item_id=glossary#boust>boustrophedon</a> style. Later texts were written exclusively from right to left. Words were generally separated by spaces, although there is one text in which words are separated by dots.</p>","fonts":[]}
