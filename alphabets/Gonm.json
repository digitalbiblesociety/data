The language is usually written in the \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Deva\u003eDevanagari\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Telu\u003eTelugu\u003c/a\u003e scripts, but, in 1928, Munshi Mangal Singh Masaram designed a script specifically for the Gondi language. An older script for writing Gondi, \u003ca href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Gong\u003eGunjala Gondi\u003c/a\u003e, is being revived in some places. The Masaram Gondi script includes thirty-six consonant letters, ten vowel letters, and ten vowel signs. The script is an abugida; each consonant letter contains an inherent a vowel which can be changed using a vowel sign. The \u003cspan class=Em\u003evirama\u003c/span\u003e symbol typical of Indic abugidas is missing from the script. Rather, the inherent vowel is cancelled by removing the horizontal line which is attached to the right of every letter. Conjuncts are formed in this way with the exception of ksạ, jña, tra, which are written with special ligatures, and combinations with RA, which exhibits contextual variation.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMasaram Gondi employs script-specific digits from 0-9. There is no script-specific punctuation; Latin punctuation is used.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["wsg","esg","gon"]}
