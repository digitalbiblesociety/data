The system is based on a code called night writing, which had been developed by Charles Barbier to enable soldiers to communicate silently and without the need for a light. Barbierâ€™s system used letters comprised of up to twelve raised dots, and proved too complex to be useful to the military.</p> <p>Louis Braille modified this concept to produce a script which used letters comprised of six dots. A dot may be raised at any or all of six positions. The script is not simply a letter by letter transcription of English words into Braille; all sixty-three possible combinations of dot positions are used, representing the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet, plus some common letter combinations and abbreviations. Some symbols also represent commonly used words, such as <span class=Em>but</span>, <span class=Em>this</span>, <span class=Em>day</span> etc.</p> <p>The sixty-fourth configuration, in which no dots are raised, leaves a space between words.</p> <p>Braille is usually written using larger letters than standard printed text, to enable the reader to more easily make the distinction between letters.</p> <p>Braille has also been adapted for use with languages that do not use the Latin script, generally following the Latin transcription conventions of that script. </p>","fonts":[]}
