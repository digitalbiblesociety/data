There were two main variants of Iberian writing. The Northeastern (or Levantine) variant is the script in which 95% of extant texts are written. It was used as far north as southern France but primarily in Catalonia, Aragonia, and Valencia, and was written from right to left. The Southeastern (or Meridional) variant was used in eastern Andalusia, Murcia, Albacete, Alicante and Valencia, and was written from left to right.</p> <p>The Iberian scripts are thought to be unique in the way they were structured. They contained features of both alphabetic and syllabic scripts. <a href=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=glossary#continuant>Continuants</a> (i.e. sounds made without complete closure of the vocal tract such as fricatives, sonorants and vowels) were written with alphabetic letters, and any following vowel had to be written with a separate letter. Non-continuants,(i.e. <a href=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=glossary#stop>stops</a>) however, were written with syllabic glyphs that represented a consonant + vowel combination.</p> <p>Some scholars also class Greco-Iberian writing as an Iberian script. It was used in Alicant and Murcia and was written from left to right. It was directly adapted from the Greek alphabet for use with the Iberian language, and does not share the same structural features with the Northeastern and Southeastern varieties.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
