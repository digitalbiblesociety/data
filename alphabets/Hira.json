The script was derived from the cursive forms of Chinese characters around the 8th century; prior to this, Japanese was written entirely in Chinese (<span class=Em>kanji</span> letters. Hiragana was originally known as <span class=Em>onnade</span> womens hand as it was primarily used by women until the 10th century when it came to be widely used by both genders.</p> <p>The script can be written either horizontally or vertically. There are 48 signs, called <span class=Em>kana</span>, 5 representing vowels, one representing the syllabic nasal /n/, and 42 representing consonant+vowel syllables. Each kana represents one mora, essentially a short syllable. Long syllables are represented by two kana. There are no symbols for writing voiced stops; rather, two small strokes called <span class=Em>nigoriten</span> are written at the upper right of a CV symbol to indicate that the consonant is voiced. There are also no symbols for syllables containing p, but a small circle (<span class=Em>maru</span>) is written to the upper right of the symbols <span class=Em>ha</span>, <span class=Em>hi</span>, <span class=Em>hu</span>, <span class=Em>he</span> and <span class=Em>ho</span> to represent <span class=Em>pa</span>, <span class=Em>pi</span>, <span class=Em>pu</span>, <span class=Em>pe</span> and <span class=Em>po</span> respectively. The script was officially standardized in 1946 to reflect spoken modern standard Japanese, although there are some exceptions to this: the grammatical markers for topic wa, direct object ɔ and direction ɛ are written with the symbols <span class=Em>ha</span>, <span class=Em>wo</span> and <span class=Em>he</span> respectively, reflecting historical pronunciation.</p> <p>The Hiragana script is a complete orthography - anything that can be said in Japanese can be written in Hiragana - but it is most commonly mixed with Chinese <span class=Em>Kanji</span> characters. In texts which use a mixture of Hiragana and Kanji characters, Hiragana is commonly used to write words phonetically, sometimes as a guide to pronunciation, and to write sentence particles and inflectional endings.</p> <p>There are two arrangements in which symbols can be ordered. The traditional order of symbols is the order in which they appear in a short poem, the <span class=Em>iroha</span>, which uses each syllable only once. However, the <span class=Em>gojuuon</span> \\\\\\fifty sound\\\\\\\" order is now more commonly used.</p> \"","fonts":[]}
