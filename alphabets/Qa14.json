Specifically, it was created to convey the teachings of Pau Cin Hau, a Tedim speaker who founded the Laipian religion. According to Pau Cin Hau, he had a dream in 1902 in which the script was revealed to him. In 1932 the script was revised and the repertoire of approximately 1,000 logographs was reduced to fifty-seven alphabetic letters to form the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/scr/Pauc>Pau Cin Hau Alphabet</a>.</p> <p><span class=Em>This script is not currently recognized by the <a href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;ISO 15924 standard</a>, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
