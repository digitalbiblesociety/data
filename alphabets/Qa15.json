During this period, a number of young writers, possibly in response to a recent influx of Bollywood films and English-language romance novels, began producing \u003cspan class=Em\u003esoyayya\u003c/span\u003e literature which was unlike previous genres of Hausa prose writing. These books tended to be no more than 100 pages and until the late 1990s were associated with particular writers’ circles to which the authors belonged.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eRaina Kama was one of the main writers’ circles. They tended to write in the Arabic or the Latin scripts, but in an effort to strengthen Hausa culture, they also promoted the use of a new alphabetic orthography using signs that were unlike either Arabic or Latin characters. Some early texts published by Raina Kama included a few handwritten pages in this script, although it never became popular. The script is not believed to be in current use.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=Em\u003eThis script is not currently recognized by the \u003ca href=http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/ target=_blank\u003e\u003cimg src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png /\u003e\u0026nbsp;ISO 15924 standard\u003c/a\u003e, but is included in ScriptSource for research purposes.
