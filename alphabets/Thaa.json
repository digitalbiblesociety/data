It is one of the few alphabets in the world which does not have its roots in the Proto-Canaanite script. Rather, the first nine letters are derived from the shapes of the numerals used in Arabic writing, and the next nine from earlier forms of Maldivian letters.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe alphabet comprises two main types of signs.
