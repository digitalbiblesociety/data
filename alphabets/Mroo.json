Traditional folklore has it that god Turai wrote down a script and a religion for the Mro people, as for all the other tribes, and gave it to a cow to deliver to them. However, the cow became tired and hungry during the long journey from heaven, and ate the book it was carrying, and the script was forever lost. Every year the Mro sacrifice a representative cow in a festival to commemorate their loss; this festival has become one of their most distinctive rituals. Until the 1980s it was a great source of shame to the Mro people that they did not have a script of their own, and Menlay Murang is held in high esteem for redeeming them from this. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIt is estimated that the literacy rate among the Mro in their own script is greater than 80%. Education in the script is available up to grade 3. Some textbooks claim that Menlay Murang based the script on Roman, Burmese and Chinese characters, although others state that any similarity to other scripts is purely coincidental. Sources agree, however, that the script bears no natural genetic relationship with any existing script.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Mro script is an alphabet; each character represents one sound, and some sounds are represented by more than one letter. It is written horizontally from left to right with spaces between words. No tone marks or combining characters are used. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTwo letters, \u003cspan class=Em\u003etek\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003ehai\u003c/span\u003e can be written instead of the respective words t…õk quote, or words containing hai, wai, or kai. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is a set of digits from 0-9, which combine in the same way as Latin digits to form larger numbers. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eTwo punctuation marks are used, called \u003cspan class=Em\u003edanda\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003edouble danda\u003c/span\u003e. These are visually different from the \u003cspan class=Em\u003edanda\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan class=Em\u003edouble danda\u003c/span\u003e used in the Brahmic scripts.\u003c/p\u003e","bibles":null,"alphabet_languages":null,"numeral_systems":null,"languages":["mro"]}
