Moreover, most Thais in the northern and the northeastern (Isaan) parts of the country today are bilingual speakers of Central Thai and their respective regional dialects due to the fact that (Central) Thai is the language of television, education, news reporting, and all forms of media.\u003c/p\u003e","shopify_id":0,"script":"Thai","beta":true,"hidden":false,"region":"Asia","country_id":null,"primary_color":"","secondary_color":"","library_resource":[]}
