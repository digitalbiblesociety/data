{"id":"titiaan","name":"Tiziano Vecelli","name_alt":"Titian","born":1488,"died":1576,"description":"Tiziano Vecelli or Vecellio, known as Titian in English, was an Italian painter of the Renaissance and a key figure in the 16th-century Venetian school. Born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno, in the Republic of Venice, Titian became known as 'da Cadore' after his native region. His contemporaries recognized him as \"The Sun Amidst Small Stars,\" reflecting the final line of Dante's \"Paradiso.\" Renowned for his versatility, Titian excelled in portraits, landscapes, and mythological and religious subjects. His innovative painting methods, especially in color application, significantly influenced painters of the Italian Renaissance and future Western art generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTitian's first major commission was for three frescoes on St Antony of Padua's life in the Scuola del Santo, Padua (1511), showcasing his firm and monumental style. After Giorgione's death and Sebastiano's departure to Rome, Titian rose to prominence in Venice, eventually becoming the official painter of the Republic following Bellini's death in 1516.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the 1510s, Titian developed his unique style, seen in works like the allegorical \"Sacred and Profane Love\" (Borghese Gallery, Rome, c. 1515). His \"Assumption of the Virgin\" (Santa Maria dei Frari, Venice, 1516-18) established his reputation, demonstrating his grandeur and color splendor. His Pesaro altarpiece and \"The Death of St Peter Martyr\" further exemplified his style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecular patrons, including Alfonso d'Este, commissioned mythological pictures like \"Worship of Venus,\" \"Bacchanal,\" and \"Bacchus and Ariadne.\" His portraits from this period, like the \"Man with a Glove\" (Louvre, c. 1520), were highly admired.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround 1530, a change in Titian's style coincided with his wife's death. His color palette became more subdued, and his compositions less adventurous. His fame spread across Europe, with significant patrons like Emperor Charles V, who appointed him court painter and elevated him to Count Palatine and Knight of the Golden Spur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTitian's later career was marked by a series of erotic mythological subjects for Philip II of Spain, referred to as 'poesie.' His late works exhibited a looser handling and a focus on intimate pathos. The \"Martyrdom of St Lawrence\" and \"Pietà\" (Accademia, Venice) displayed his continued brilliance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTitian's influence extended beyond his lifetime, inspiring artists like Poussin, Rubens, and Velázquez. His portrait work set patterns for future generations, and his expressive brushwork revolutionized oil painting. Despite his avarice, Titian was known for his hospitality and was part of a close triumvirate with poet Pietro Aretino and architect Jacopo Sansovino, influencing each other's careers.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian","url_wga":"https://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiziano/10/21/","nationality":"Italian","movement":"Italian Renaissance","artworks":[{"id":"5779","author_id":"titiaan","title":"Behold the Man","filename":"titiaan-behold-the-man-christ-full.jpg","reference":"JN19_1","keywords":"jesus pliate behold man","type":"Bible Art","year":1550,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"5781","author_id":"titiaan","title":"David and Goliath","filename":"titiaan-david-goliath-grt-full.jpg","reference":"S117_1","keywords":"david goliath grt","type":"Bible Art","year":1544,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"5783","author_id":"titiaan","title":"The Crowning with Thorns (1545)","filename":"titiaan-doornen1-grt-full.jpg","reference":"MT27_27","keywords":"crown thorns","type":"Bible Art","year":1545,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"5784","author_id":"titiaan","description":"The Roman governor Pilate shows the captured Jesus to the people that wants to crucify him: Behold the man!\" It is hard to see from his expression whether Pilate feels compassion or disgust.

Titian captured the startling moment. On the table are the ingredients of the Eucharist: bread and wine. The crisp white tablecloth strengthens the suggestion of a church altar. The blue flowers on the table are borage flowers. In Venice they were used to add a fresh flavour to wine and salads. The dog under the table may refer to a passage in Matthew 15. There a non-Jewish woman tells Jesus that even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall of his table, suggesting that he may be relevant to non-Jews as well. The dog is playing with a cat: a playful detail, unusual for Titian. The canvas was probably ordered by the Maffei family of Verona. The Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool has an almost identical work, on loan from the collection of the Earl of Yarborough. It was probably executed by assistants in Titian's workshop. The Judas in Leonardo's Last Supper may have served as an example for the man in green on the left. Some 70 years later Caravaggio would use Titian's composition in his Supper at Emmaus.","title":"Supper at Emmaus","filename":"titiaan-emmaus-louvre-grt-full.jpg","reference":"LK24_13","type":"Bible Art","year":1535,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"5787","author_id":"titiaan","description":"This is almost an exact copy of Titian's earlier work.
