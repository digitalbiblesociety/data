{"id":"giovanni-bellini","name":"Giovanni Bellini","name_alt":"Bellini","born":1430,"died":1516,"description":"Giovanni Bellini, a preeminent Italian Renaissance painter from the Venetian Bellini family, was celebrated for revolutionizing Venetian art towards a sensuous, color-rich style. Born in Venice around 1430, he was Jacopo Bellini's son and Gentile Bellini's brother, both esteemed painters. Giovanni's brother-in-law, Andrea Mantegna, also influenced his early style, which was initially rigid and severe, yet deeply spiritual. His early works, like the \"Agony in the Garden,\" already showcased his evolving style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In the 1470s, Bellini's artistry underwent a significant transformation. Influenced by Flemish painting and Antonello da Messina, he started using oil paints, leading to a more integrated treatment of color, light, and atmosphere. This period saw masterpieces like \"Madonna of the Trees\" and \"Madonna with Saints.\" Bellini also contributed to the Hall of the Great Council in Venice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e His later works, such as \"Madonna with Saints\" at San Zaccaria, demonstrate his mature style, characterized by harmonious color and a naturalistic depiction of light and atmosphere. One of his final works, \"The Feast of the Gods,\" completed with Titian's collaboration, displays his versatility. Bellini's landscape paintings from his career's end were remarkable for their depiction of outdoor light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Bellini's influence extended to his pupils, Giorgione and Titian, and he was highly regarded by contemporaries like Albrecht DÃ¼rer. His death in 1516 marked the end of a career that had a profound impact on Western art, characterized by luminous colorism, a deep connection to nature, and warm humanity. Bellini's evolution as an artist played a crucial role in elevating Venetian painting to the forefront of the Renaissance.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Bellini","url_wga":"https://www.wga.hu/html/b/bellini/giovanni/1460-69/","nationality":"Italian","movement":"Italian Renaissance","artworks":[{"id":"2646","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"Agony in the Garden","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1459-presentation-temple-full.jpg","reference":"MK14_32","keywords":"presentation temple","type":"Bible Art","year":1459,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2648","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"Resurrection","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1465-agony-in-the-garden-full.jpg","reference":"MK16_1","keywords":"agony","type":"Bible Art","year":1465,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2651","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"Christ is Risen","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1479-ascendtion-of-christ-full.jpg","reference":"JN20_1","type":"Bible Art","year":1479,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2655","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"Noah and His Sons","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1480-drunkenness-of-noah-bellini-full.jpg","reference":"GN9_18","keywords":" drunkenness noah bellini","type":"Bible Art","year":1480,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2658","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"The Transfiguration","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1480-transfiguration-of-christ-full.jpg","reference":"MT17_1","keywords":" transfiguration christ","type":"Bible Art","year":1480,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2661","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"The Transfiguration","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1480-transfiguration-of-christ-ii-full.jpg","reference":"MT17_1","keywords":" transfiguration christ ii","type":"Bible Art","year":1480,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2664","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"The Crucifixion","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1505-pieta-full.jpg","reference":"MT27_32","keywords":"pieta","type":"Bible Art","year":1505,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2667","author_id":"giovanni-bellini","title":"The Burial of Jesus","filename":"giovanni-bellini-1530-lamentation-over-the-dead-christ-full.jpg","reference":"MT27_57","keywords":" lamentation over dead christ","type":"Bible Art","year":1530,"author":{"id":""}}]}
