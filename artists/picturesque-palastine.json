The series was edited by Sir Charles William Wilson and prominently featured illustrations by John Douglas Woodward and Harry Fenn. These illustrations were based on their joint travels during the winters of 1877–78 and 1878–79. This comprehensive work is notable for its hundreds of historic pictures depicting the landscapes and cultural heritage of Palestine and Egypt. For those interested in exploring this rich visual documentation, the series is accessible online via the Internet Archive at https://archive.org/details/picturesquepales01wils_0. This resource offers a unique historical perspective and serves as a valuable reference for those interested in the geography, history, and cultural legacy of these regions.\r","url_wiki":"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Picturesque_Palestine,_Sinai,_and_Egypt","nationality":"British","artworks":[{"id":"67","author_id":"picturesque-palastine","title":"A
