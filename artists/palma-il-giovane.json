{"id":"palma-il-giovane","name":"Palma Il Giovane","name_alt":"Iacopo Negretti, Jacopo, Giacomo Palma il Giovane, or simply Palma Giovane ","born":1548,"died":1628,"description":"Iacopo Negretti, more commonly known as Jacopo or Giacomo Palma il Giovane or simply Palma Giovane, was an eminent Italian painter from Venice, recognized as a significant exponent of the Venetian school. Born into a family of painters, he was the great-nephew of Palma Vecchio (\"Old Palma\") and the son of Antonio Nigreti, a minor painter in Palma Vecchio's workshop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn in Venice between 1548 and 1550, Palma Giovane's career took a significant turn following Tintoretto's death in 1594, as he became the leading artist in Venice, perpetuating Tintoretto's style. His work extended beyond Venice, with commissions in Bergamo and Central Europe, most notably from Emperor Rudolph II in Prague.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePalma Giovane's early training included making copies of Titian's works, shaping his style. His talent was recognized by Guidobaldo II della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino, who supported him and sent him to Rome around 1567. Returning to Venice circa 1572, he adopted Tintoretto's mannerisms and was even believed to have been a part of Titian's workshop, completing Titian's last work, the 'Piet√†', after his death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis major commissions included three scenes for the Doge's Palace after a fire in 1577, where he worked alongside Veronese and Tintoretto. From 1580-1590, he painted large canvas cycles for Venetian Schools and sacred buildings, which are considered among his best works. After 1594, he became a prominent figure in Venice, leading a large studio and producing numerous religious and allegorical paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePalma Giovane also painted mythologies for intellectuals post-1600 and created a magnificent portrait of Saint Pope Pius V, now in the Chianciano Museum of Art. He passed away on October 14, 1628, and was buried in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. His influence extended to artists like the Brescian painter Camillo Rama, and his legacy as a leading painter in Venice endures to this day.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_il_Giovane","url_wga":"https://www.wga.hu/html/p/palma/giovane/1/","nationality":"Italian","artworks":[{"id":"4357","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"Cain Murders Abel","filename":"palma-il-giovane-1576-cain-and-abel-full.jpg","reference":"GN4_1","keywords":" cain abel","type":"Bible Art","year":1576,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4359","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"The Crucifixion","filename":"palma-il-giovane-1579-roman-centurian-at-crucifixion-full.jpg","reference":"MT27_32","keywords":" roman centurian crucifixion","type":"Bible Art","year":1579,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4361","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"The Prodigal Son","filename":"palma-il-giovane-1580-return-of-the-prodigal-son-full.jpg","reference":"LK15_11","keywords":" return prodigal son","type":"Bible Art","year":1580,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4363","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"The Crucifixion","filename":"palma-il-giovane-1590-crucifixion-of-christ-full.jpg","reference":"MK15_21","keywords":" crucifixion christ","type":"Bible Art","year":1590,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4365","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"Jesus Washes His Disciples Feet","filename":"palma-il-giovane-1591-washing-the-disciples-feet-full.jpg","reference":"JN13_1","keywords":" washing disciples feet","type":"Bible Art","year":1591,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4367","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"The Prodigal Son","filename":"palma-il-giovane-1595-amusements-of-the-prodigal-son-full.jpg","reference":"LK15_11","keywords":" amusements prodigal son","type":"Bible Art","year":1595,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4369","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"The Adoration of the Magi","filename":"palma-il-giovane-adoration-of-the-magi-full.jpg","reference":"LK2_8","keywords":"adoration magi","type":"Bible Art","year":1600,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4371","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"On the Road to Calvery","filename":"palma-il-giovane-christ-on-the-road-to-calvary-full.jpg","reference":"MK15_21","keywords":"christ road calvary","type":"Bible Art","year":1600,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4373","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"Gethering the Manna from Heaven","filename":"palma-il-giovane-gathering-the-manna-full.jpg","reference":"EX16_1","keywords":"gathering manna","type":"Bible Art","year":1600,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4375","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"The Bronze Serpent","filename":"palma-il-giovane-moses-raising-the-bronze-serpent-full.jpg","reference":"NU21_4","keywords":"moses raising bronze serpent","type":"Bible Art","year":1600,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"4382","author_id":"palma-il-giovane","title":"The Burial of Jesus","filename":"palma-il-giovane-preparing-christ-for-burial-full.jpg","reference":"MT27_57","keywords":"preparing christ for burial","type":"Bible Art","year":1600,"author":{"id":""}}]}
