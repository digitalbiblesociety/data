{"id":"aert-de-gelder","name":"Aert de Gelder","name_alt":"De Gelder","born":1645,"died":1727,"description":"Born and later laid to rest in Dordrecht, De Gelder was not only a prodigious pupil of the legendary Rembrandt during his tenure in Amsterdam from 1661 to 1663 but also one of his most ardent adherents. His unwavering commitment to the late style of Rembrandt made him a unique figure, being the lone Dutch artist to carry this tradition into the 18th century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDe Gelder's works, such as \"The Baptism of Christ\" and \"Ahimelech Giving the Sword of Goliath to David\", echo Rembrandt's distinctive narrative style, characterized by transparent emotional depth and a profound emphasis on the human aspects of biblical figures. This stood in stark contrast to the prevailing artistic trends of his time, particularly the detached, courtly representations of the Renaissance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough heavily influenced by Rembrandt, De Gelder wasn't a mere imitator. His paintings exhibited a unique flair, marked by inventive storytelling, a penchant for theatricality, and deeply emotive character depictions. These attributes cemented his reputation as a pivotal figure in late 17th-century Dutch painting.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aert_de_Gelder","nationality":"Dutch","movement":"Dutch Golden Age","artworks":[{"id":"107","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"Rebecca","filename":"aert-de-gelder-1665-isaac-meets-rebekah-full.jpg","reference":"GN24_1","keywords":" isaac meets rebekah","type":"Bible Art","year":1665,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"113","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"Judah and Tamar","filename":"aert-de-gelder-1667-judah-and-tamar-genesis-38-16-full.jpg","reference":"GN38_1","keywords":" judah tamar genesis  ","type":"Bible Art","year":1667,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"116","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"Judah and Tamar","filename":"aert-de-gelder-1681-judah-and-tamar-genesis-38-16-full.jpg","reference":"GN38_1","keywords":" judah tamar genesis  ","type":"Bible Art","year":1681,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"119","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"Esther Accuses Haman","filename":"aert-de-gelder-1682-ahasuerus-and-haman-esther-3-9-full.jpg","reference":"ET7_1","keywords":" ahasuerus haman esther  ","type":"Bible Art","year":1682,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"121","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"Adonijah Presumes the Crown","filename":"aert-de-gelder-1685-bathsheba-appeal-david-1kings-1-16-full.jpg","reference":"K11_1","keywords":" bathsheba makes an appeal david kings  ","type":"Bible Art","year":1685,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"124","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"The Prophesy of Simeon and Anna","filename":"aert-de-gelder-1700-simeon-and-anna-praise-jesus-luke-2-full.jpg","reference":"LK2_22","keywords":" simeon anna praise infant jesus luke ","type":"Bible Art","year":1700,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"129","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"Jesus Before the Sanhedrin","filename":"aert-de-gelder-1715-jesus-taken-house-of-the-high-priest-full.jpg","reference":"LK22_66","keywords":" jesus taken house high priest","type":"Bible Art","year":1715,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"134","author_id":"aert-de-gelder","title":"A Woman Caught In the Act of Adultery","filename":"aert-de-gelder-christ-and-the-adulteress-full.jpg","reference":"JN8_1","keywords":"christ adulteress","type":"Bible Art","year":1700,"author":{"id":""}}]}
