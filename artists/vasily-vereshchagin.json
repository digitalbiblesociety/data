His work is particularly notable for its realistic portrayal of military scenes, which often carried a graphic intensity. This unflinching realism in depicting the brutalities and horrors of war led to many of his works being considered too graphic for printing or public exhibition during his lifetime. Vereshchagin's dedication to portraying war with such raw honesty was groundbreaking, offering a stark contrast to the glorified depictions of battle common in art of that era. His impactful and often controversial works provided a candid look at the realities of war, making him a significant figure in the world of realist art.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Vereshchagin","url_wga":"https://www.wga.hu/html/v/vereshch/vasily/","nationality":"Russian","artworks":[{"id":"5706","author_id":"vasily-vereshchagin","title":"Apotheosis of War","filename":"vasily-vereshchagin-apotheosis-of-war-full.jpg","reference":"JR7_30","keywords":"Apotheosis of War","type":"Bible Art","year":1890,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"5709","author_id":"vasily-vereshchagin","title":"The Crucifixion","filename":"vasily-vereshchagin-crucifixion-by-the-romans-full.jpg","reference":"MT27_32","keywords":"Crucifixion by The Romans","type":"Bible Art","year":1890,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"5712","author_id":"vasily-vereshchagin","title":"Night Over Golgotha","filename":"vasily-vereshchagin-night-over-golgotha-full.jpg","reference":"JN19_38","keywords":"Night Over Golgotha","type":"Bible Art","year":1890,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"5715","author_id":"vasily-vereshchagin","title":"The Crucifixion","filename":"vasily-vereshchagin-women-at-the-crucifiction-by-the-romans-full.jpg","reference":"MT27_32","keywords":"Women at The Crucifiction by The Romans","type":"Bible Art","year":1890,"author":{"id":""}}]}
