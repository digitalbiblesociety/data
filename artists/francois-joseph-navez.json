{"id":"francois-joseph-navez","name":"Francois Joseph Navez","born":1787,"died":1869,"description":"François-Joseph Navez, born on 16 November 1787 in Charleroi and passing away on 12 October 1869 in Brussels, was a distinguished Belgian neo-classical painter. A pupil of the eminent Jacques-Louis David, Navez spent a significant period, from 1817 to 1822, in Italy, where he further honed his artistic skills. His career included an influential tenure as the director of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, a position he held from 1835 to 1862.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNavez was particularly renowned for his skill in portrait painting, but his artistic repertoire also included numerous mythological and historical subjects. His success in the field of portrait painting was marked by his ability to capture the essence and character of his subjects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong his notable pupils was the orientalist painter Jean-François Portaels, who was also his son-in-law. Additionally, Jean Carolus, a Belgian painter known for his genre scenes and interiors, was a protege of François-Joseph Navez. Navez's contribution to the neo-classical movement and his influence in the Belgian art scene of the 19th century remain significant, marked by his mentorship of future artists and his directorship at one of the leading art academies of the time.\r","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Joseph_Navez","url_wga":"https://www.wga.hu/html/n/navez/","nationality":"Belgian","artworks":[{"id":"2299","author_id":"francois-joseph-navez","title":"Doubting Thomas","filename":"francois-joseph-1823-navez-the-incredulity-thomas-full.jpg","reference":"JN20_24","keywords":"the incredulity thomas","type":"Bible Art","year":1823,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2302","author_id":"francois-joseph-navez","title":"Massacre in Bethlehem","filename":"francois-joseph-1824-navez-the-massacre-innocents-at-ankara-full.jpg","reference":"MT2_16","keywords":"the massacre innocents ankara","type":"Bible Art","year":1824,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2306","author_id":"francois-joseph-navez","title":"Hagar and Ishmael","filename":"francois-joseph-navez-1819-hagar-ishmael-wildernes-full.jpg","reference":"GN16_1","keywords":" Hagar Ishmael Wildernes","type":"Bible Art","year":1819,"author":{"id":""}},{"id":"2310","author_id":"francois-joseph-navez","title":"Doubting Thomas","filename":"francois-joseph-navez-1823-the-incredulity-of-thomas-full.jpg","reference":"JN20_24","keywords":" The Incredulity of Thomas","type":"Bible Art","year":1823,"author":{"id":""}}]}
