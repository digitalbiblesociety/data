Marwari is also found in the neighboring states of Gujarat and Haryana, some adjacent areas in Eastern parts of Pakistan, and some migrant communities in Nepal. With some 7.8 million or so speakers (ca. 2011), it is one of the largest varieties of Rajasthani. Most speakers live in Rajasthan, with a quarter-million in Sindh and a tenth of that number in Nepal. There are two dozen dialects of Marwari.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarwari is popularly written in Devanagari script, as are many languages of India and Nepal, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and Sanskrit; although it was historically written in Mahajani, it is still written in the Perso-Arabic script by the Marwari minority in Eastern parts of Pakistan (the standard/western Naskh script variant is used in Sindh Province, and the eastern Nastalik variant is used in Punjab Province), where it has educational status but where it is rapidly shifting to Urdu.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"509","iso":"mve","year":1821,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MVEMNT_DBS_HS/Marwari-John-(book)","language":{"iso":"mve","glotto_id":"marw1256","name":"Marwari (Pakistan)","autonym":"मारवाड़ी/مارواڑی‎","level":"L","location":"Southern Pakistan","area":"Northern Marwari in south Punjab and north Sindh, north of Dadu and Nawabshah; Southern Marwari in Sindh and south Punjab provinces, between Tando Mohammed Khan and Tando Ghulam Ali to the south, Dadu and Nawabshab to the north.","country_id":"PK","latitude":28.32418,"longitude":71.56714,"population":164000,"status_id":"4"}}
