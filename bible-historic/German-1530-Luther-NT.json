By 1534, Luther and his team completed translating the Old Testament, culminating in the publication of the complete Bible. Luther's commitment to refining this translation endured throughout his lifetime. His work followed earlier German translations like the Mentelin Bible (1456) and the Koberger Bible (1484), but Luther's version was distinct in its alignment with his doctrinal views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuther's translation utilized the German variant spoken in the Saxon chancellery, making it understandable to both northern and southern Germans. His aim was to produce a text in vigorous, direct language, accessible to everyday people. Released during a surge in demand for German-language publications, Luther's translation gained rapid popularity and significantly influenced German language and literature. It was furnished with notes and prefaces by Luther and featured woodcuts by Lucas Cranach, some containing anti-papal imagery, furthering the dissemination of Luther's doctrines. Additionally, the Luther Bible influenced other vernacular translations, including the Tyndale Bible, a precursor to the King James Bible.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"91","iso":"deu","year":1530,"type":"book","provider":"GreatSite.com","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"DEUL45_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","level":"L","location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"DE","latitude":48.648954,"longitude":12.467623,"population":76100000,"status_id":"1"}}
