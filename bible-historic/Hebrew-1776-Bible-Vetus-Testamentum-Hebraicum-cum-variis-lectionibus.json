It presents the consonantal text of the Hebrew Scriptures following the Masoretic tradition, which is the authoritative Jewish text of the Hebrew Bible. This edition is distinguished by its presentation of the Pentateuch – the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, namely Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. What makes this edition particularly significant is its parallel presentation of the Masoretic text of the Pentateuch alongside the Samaritan Pentateuch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe inclusion of both the Masoretic and Samaritan versions of the Pentateuch allows for comparative study and highlights the differences between these two textual traditions. The Masoretic text, which forms the basis of most modern Jewish and Christian translations of the Old Testament, is contrasted with the Samaritan Pentateuch, an older version of the Torah preserved by the Samaritan community. This parallel format is invaluable for scholars and students interested in the textual history and variances within ancient Hebrew manuscripts, offering insights into the development and transmission of the biblical text over centuries.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"113","iso":"hbo","year":1776,"type":"study","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HBOVTH_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"hbo","glotto_id":"anci1244","name":"Ancient Hebrew","autonym":"עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית","level":"H","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.77607,"longitude":35.17248,"status_id":"9"}}
