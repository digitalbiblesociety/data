Rarotonga is spoken by most of the 9,000 inhabitants of the island of that name. Typical of Polynesian languages, only 13 letters are needed to represent all the sounds employed in speaking. Little dialectal difference is noted in the usage of the other islands (exclusive of Niue).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRev. John Williams with the support of Rev. Aaron Buzzacott and Rev. Charles Pittman translated the New Testament in the late 1820s through to the early 1830s.
