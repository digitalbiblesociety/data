Psalter of Saint Germain (WDL-20008)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Psalter of Saint Germain of Paris, cataloged as Latin 11947 in the National Library of France, dates back to around 500 AD. Saint Germain, born circa 496 in France, became the bishop of Paris in 555, a position he held until his death in 576. This psalter comprises the Psalms from an Old Latin Bible version, translations that predate Saint Jerome's Vulgate, completed in the late fourth century. Written in uncial script on crimson parchment using silver ink, the manuscript features 70 gold ink letters 'R' in the left margin. These 'R' letters, standing for responsa (responsory), indicate the liturgical use of the psalms. Additionally, the initial pages include a transcription from Jerome’s preface to the book of Job, highlighting the ancient use of purple parchment for luxury manuscripts. This manuscript is a notable example of early medieval script and religious text, reflecting both the liturgical and artistic traditions of the time.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/20008","filesize":"116","iso":"lat","year":500,"type":"scan","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATGERM_DBS_HS/Latin-(0500-ca.)-Psalter-of-Saint-Germain-(WDL-20008)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
