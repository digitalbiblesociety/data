It is also spoken in some parts of Bayelsa. The Isoko language has close similarities with them and Edo people with other Edoid languages because it is an Edoid language, the Isoko people are “an ethnic nationality made up of people and their ancestral roots can be traced through history to the Benin (Aka) kingdom, attested to by the linguistic and cultural similarities that exist between the Isoko people and the Benin (Aka)people” although a few of the Isoko communities or clans have their origins attached to the Ibo language and Urhobo language. Some 750,000 people consider themselves Isoko. Language is a mark of identity and plays an all-important role in the life of a people. The Isoko language, however, is being threatened with extinction as reported by Idudhe (2002), as a result of neglect in teaching, learning, and use. The Isoko language has about 20 to 21 dialects, but the Aviara/Uzere dialect is the standard dialect of the language.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"165","iso":"iso","year":1977,"type":"genesis","provider":"United Bible Societies","org_id":"united-bible-societies","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"ISOFUL_DBS_HS/Isoko-(1977)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"iso","glotto_id":"isok1239","name":"Isoko","autonym":"Biotu","level":"L","location":"Nigeria, Map 9","area":"Delta state, Isoko and Ndokwa LGAs.","country_id":"NG","latitude":5.52889,"longitude":6.24682,"population":647000,"status_id":"5"}}
