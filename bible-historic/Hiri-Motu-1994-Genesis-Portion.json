Although it is strictly neither a pidgin nor a creole, it possesses some features from both language types. Phonological and grammatical differences make Hiri Motu not mutually intelligible with Motu. The languages are lexically very similar, and retain a common, albeit simplified, Austronesian syntactical basis. It has also been influenced to some degree by Tok Pisin.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"249","iso":"hmo","year":1994,"type":"genesis","provider":"Bible Society of Papua New Guinea","org_id":"bible-society-of-papua-new-guinea","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"HMOPNG_DBS_HS/Hiri-Motu-(1994)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"hmo","glotto_id":"hiri1237","iso1":"ho","name":"Hiri Motu","autonym":"Police Motu","level":"L","area":"Central Province, Port Moresby area; some in Oro, Central, Gulf, Milne Bay, Western provinces.","country_id":"PG","latitude":-9.33333,"longitude":147.08332,"population":120000,"status_id":"3"}}
