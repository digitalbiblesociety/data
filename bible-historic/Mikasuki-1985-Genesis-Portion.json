Along with Creek, it is also known as Seminole. It is spoken by the Miccosukee tribe and many Florida Seminoles. The extinct Hitchiti was a mutually intelligible dialect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Seminole and Miccosukee were made up of mostly Creek members of the Creek Confederacy, who had migrated to Florida under pressure from European-American encroachment. The Seminole was formed by a process of ethnogenesis in the 18th century. American settlers began to enter Florida and came into conflict with the Seminole. The Seminole Wars of the 19th century greatly depleted the numbers of these tribes, especially the Second Seminole War. The United States forcibly removed many Seminole to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). The Seminole and Miccosukee had gradually moved into the center of Florida and the Everglades, from where they resisted defeat even in the Third Seminole War. The US gave up efforts against them.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"334","iso":"mik","year":1985,"type":"genesis","provider":"Wycliffe Bible Translators","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"MIKSGN_DBS_HS/Mikasuki-(1985)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"mik","glotto_id":"mika1239","name":"Mikasuki","autonym":"Hitchiti-Mikasuki","level":"L","location":"Southeastern United States of America","area":"South Florida.","country_id":"US","latitude":26.08142,"longitude":-80.90847,"population":290,"status_id":"6b"}}
