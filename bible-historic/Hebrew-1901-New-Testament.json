{"id":"Hebrew-1901-New-Testament","abbr":"HEBN01","title":"Hebrew (1901) New Testament","title_vernacular":"עברית - הברית החדשה (1901)","description":"The 1901 Hebrew New Testament is a notable edition within the broader context of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh, which is the canonical collection of Hebrew scriptures in Judaism. This collection comprises the Torah (Law), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings). Over the centuries, different branches of Judaism and Samaritanism have maintained various versions of this canon, reflecting the diverse traditions and interpretations within these communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSignificant versions include the 3rd-century Septuagint text used by Second-Temple Judaism, the Syriac language Peshitta, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the medieval Masoretic text from the 10th century, developed by the Masoretes and used in modern Rabbinic Judaism. It's important to note that while the terms \"Hebrew Bible\" or \"Hebrew Canon\" are often associated with the Masoretic text, this is just one of several texts considered authoritative in different Jewish traditions over time. The Masoretic text is primarily in Biblical Hebrew, with some sections in Biblical Aramaic, notably in the books of Daniel and Ezra, and in Jeremiah 10:11. The 1901 Hebrew New Testament reflects this rich textual tradition and the ongoing evolution of biblical scholarship.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"810","iso":"heb","year":1901,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HEBN01_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1901)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"heb","glotto_id":"hebr1245","iso1":"he","name":"Hebrew","autonym":"Israeli Hebrew","level":"L","area":"Also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, Panama, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.10565,"longitude":35.01788,"population":5000000,"status_id":"1"}}
