Benediktbeuern Gospel - Illuminated (WDL-13474)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDating from the mid-11th century, the Benediktbeuern Gospel is a richly decorated manuscript featuring 16 canon tables, nine full-page carpet pages, initial pages, decorated pages, and four portraits of the Evangelists, each rendered on single pages. The Evangelists are symbolically represented with their traditional icons: Matthew with an angel, Mark with a lion, Luke with an ox, and John with an eagle, along with the dove of the Holy Spirit, symbolizing divine inspiration. The emphasis on specific liturgical feast days within the text suggests its origination in North Germany. An inscription on folio 3 verso reveals that by the late Middle Ages, the Gospel book belonged to the Niederaltaich Abbey in southern Bavaria, where its cover was restored in 1601. Following the monastery's dissolution, the manuscript was transferred to Munich in 1803. This Gospel book not only exemplifies medieval religious art but also provides insight into the regional liturgical practices of the time.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13474","filesize":"65","iso":"lat","year":1100,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATBENE_DBS_HS/Latin-(1100-ca.)-Benediktbeuern-Gospel-Illuminated-(WDL-13474)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
