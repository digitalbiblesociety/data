These translations were part of a broader initiative that spanned several years, beginning with Luke in 1852, followed by Matthew and John in 1853, Mark in 1854, Acts in 1855, and portions of the Old Testament between 1860 and 1861. This work was carried out by missionaries in Ningpo, notable among them William A. Russell of the Church Mission Society, Divie B. McCartee, William A. P. Martin, and Henry V. N. Rankin from the American Presbyterian Mission. These translations not only facilitated the spread of Christianity in the region but also contributed to the linguistic study of the Ningpo dialect and its use in religious texts. A significant revision of Genesis and Exodus was later published in 1871 by the American Bible Society in Shanghai, further indicating the ongoing commitment to refining and enhancing the accessibility of biblical texts to the Ningpo-speaking community.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"10","iso":"wuu","year":1853,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"WUURNT_DBS_HS/Chinese-Ningpo-(1853)-John-(latin)","language":{"iso":"wuu","glotto_id":"wuch1236","name":"Wu Chinese","autonym":"吳語/吴语","level":"L","location":"China","area":"Jiangsu south of Changjiang River, east of Zhenjiang, on Chongming Island, mouth of the Changjiang, and north of the Changjiang in the area around Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Qingjiang; Zhejiang Province south to Quzhou, Jinhua, and Wenzhou.
