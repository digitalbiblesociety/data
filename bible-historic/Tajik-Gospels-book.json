{"id":"Tajik-Gospels-book","abbr":"TGKIBC","title":"Tajik - Gospels (Book)","title_vernacular":"Tajik Инҷил","description":"Tajik, also called Tajiki Persian or Tajiki, is the variety of Persian spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by Tajiks. It is closely related to neighboring Dari with which it forms a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of the Persian language. Several scholars consider Tajik as a dialectal variety of Persian rather than a language on its own. The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that, during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian, prominent intellectual Sadriddin Ayni counterargued that Tajik was not a \"bastardised dialect\" of Persian. The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages has political sides to it.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"919","iso":"tgk","year":1992,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"TGKIBC_DBS_HS/Tajik-Gospels-(book)","language":{"iso":"tgk","glotto_id":"taji1245","iso1":"tg","name":"Tajik","autonym":"Тоҷикӣ (Tojikī)","level":"L","location":"Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan","area":"Also in Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russian Federation (Asia), Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"TJ","latitude":38.82131,"longitude":68.55493,"population":8132320,"status_id":"1"}}
