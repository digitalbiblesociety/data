Commissioned by Ludwig VII, Duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, the manuscript exemplifies high calligraphic and artistic standards. Initially, the manuscript's text was completed in Ingolstadt before being sent to Regensburg for illumination, but only about one-fifth of the intended miniatures were finished. Count Palatine Ottheinrich later acquired the incomplete work and, in 1530â€“31, had the artist Mathis Gerung complete the illuminations, extending the miniatures to cover the entire New Testament. This resulted in a collection of 146 miniatures and 294 ornamented initials spread over 307 parchment leaves. The manuscript's journey through history saw it taken as war booty, eventually leading to its division into eight volumes in the 19th century. The Bavarian State Library consolidated this significant piece of German religious and cultural heritage by acquiring three volumes in 1950 and the remaining five in 2007, preserving a masterpiece of illumination and a testament to the religious fervor and artistic ambition of its era.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/17194","filesize":"234","iso":"goh","year":1450,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GOHOTTH_DBS_HS/German-High-(1450-ca.)-Ottheinrich-Bible-Vol.-1-8-Illuminated-(WDL-4106)","language":{"iso":"goh","glotto_id":"oldh1241","name":"Old High German (ca. 750-1050)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
