New York: Greenwood Press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhilip Doddridge was an early 18th century non-conformist pastor, and like Matthew Henry, he spent much of his free time writing his commentary. Doddridge notes in the preface that he intended this commentary to be used by families at the dinner table. The forgotten practice of family worship is a great way to use this commentary; the expanded translation, and the devotions at the end of each section (see below) work together seamlessly as a perfect tool for family devotional reading and discussion. This may well be the book that Jonathan Edwards used for his family devotions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Family Expositor is an extraordinary work. Doddridge deems it “a paraphrase,” but it is much more than that. Really it’s three works in one. It is a puritan translation and expansion on the text, a puritan commentary on the text, and a puritan devotional work on the text. Doddridge combines these three to make a truly great puritan companion to the New Testament.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Doddridge","filesize":"644","iso":"eng","year":1825,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGFAM_DBS_HS/English-(1825)-Family-Expositer-New-Testament-(Doddridge)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
