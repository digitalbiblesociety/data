Their population is about 7700. Theirs is a hunter-gatherer culture for the most part, although they also practice slash-and-burn agriculture. The main crop grown is cassava, and their main source of protein is the paca, a large 6–12 kg (13–26 lb) rodent. During the dry season, the Machiguenga also use fishing to supplement the protein in their diet.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"521","iso":"mcb","year":1997,"type":"genesis","provider":"The Bible League","org_id":"bible-league-international","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"MSBWBT_DBS_HS/Machiguenga-(1997)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"mcb","glotto_id":"mach1267","name":"Machiguenga","autonym":"Matsigenka","level":"L","location":"Peru","area":"Urubamba, Camisea, Picha, Manu, Timpia, Tigompinia, Kompiroshiato, and Mishagua rivers.","country_id":"PE","latitude":-12.12905,"longitude":-72.50171,"population":21400,"status_id":"5"}}
