This Southern German translation encompasses the Old Testament from Genesis (partially starting from 24:19) to the Second Book of Kings and includes a Psalter in the first volume. Intriguingly, early chapters of Matthew's Gospel are mistakenly bound within, between Numbers and Deuteronomy. The manuscript is embellished with 60 miniatures and floral motifs, exhibiting a style akin to, yet slightly predating, the work of Berthold Furtmeyr, a celebrated German illuminator. The second volume completes the Old Testament narrative from I and II Chronicles to Malachi and features prologues to various biblical books, including contributions from the Frankish monk Rabanus Maurus to the Maccabees. It is adorned with 52 miniatures, continuing the stylistic resemblance to Furtmeyr's illuminations. This collection is significant for its artistic merit, historical context, and the insight it provides into the religious and cultural milieu of 15th-century Southern Germany.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18195","filesize":"402","iso":"gmh","year":1463,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GMHRORE_DBS_HS/German-Middle-(1463)-Rorer-Old-Testament-Illuminated-Vol.-1-of-2-(WDL-8916)","language":{"iso":"gmh","glotto_id":"midd1343","name":"Middle High German (ca. 1050-1500)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
