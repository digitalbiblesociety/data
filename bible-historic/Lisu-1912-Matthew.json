Although various regional dialects exist, the Lisus are generally divided into three groups based on differences ofdress: Pai (white), He (Black), and Hwa (Flowered). Eastern Lisu is the usage common to a small group of savagely independent Black Lisu of northern Yunnan. Lisu is classed linguistically with Akha and Lahu in what is generally termed the Lolo group of languages, related within the Tibeto-Burman family to the Burmese, Kachin, and Kuki-Chin tongues. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePollard Syllabic Script: 1912 Matthew BFBS, Shanghai Translated by A.
