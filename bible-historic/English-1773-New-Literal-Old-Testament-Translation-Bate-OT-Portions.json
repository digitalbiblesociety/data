{"id":"English-1773-New-Literal-Old-Testament-Translation-Bate-OT-Portions","abbr":"ENGLIT","title":"English (1773) New Literal Old Testament Translation (Bate) OT Portions","title_vernacular":"","description":"The 1773 publication \"A New and Literal Translation, from the Original Hebrew of the Pentateuch of Moses, and of the Historical Books of the Old Testament to the end of the Second Book of Kings,\" by Julius Bate, represents a unique attempt in the field of Bible translations. Published in London by W. Faden, this work focuses on a highly literal translation of significant portions of the Old Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBate's translation, covering the Pentateuch and the historical books up to the Second Book of Kings, is noted for its strict adherence to the literal sense of the Hebrew text. However, this approach led to a translation that the Monthly Review OS, Vol. 1 described as \"so very literal as to be really unintelligible to a plain English reader.\" This critique highlights the challenge of producing a translation that is both faithful to the original language and comprehensible to contemporary readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJulius Bate's work, while a noteworthy effort in translating the Hebrew Scriptures, exemplifies the difficulties translators face in balancing literal accuracy with readability. His translation remains an interesting contribution to the history of English Bible translations, particularly in its pursuit of a literal interpretation of the Hebrew text.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Bate","filesize":"14","iso":"eng","year":1773,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGLIT_DBS_HS/English-(1773)-New-Literal-Old-Testament-Translation-(Bate)-OT-Portions","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
