{"id":"Hebrew-0895-Cairo-Codex-facsimilie","abbr":"HBOCAIR","title":"Hebrew (0895) Cairo Codex (facsimilie)","title_vernacular":"עברית - כתב יד קהיר (0895, פקסימיליה)","description":"The Codex Cairensis, also known as the Codex Prophetarum Cairensis or Cairo Codex of the Prophets, is a significant Hebrew manuscript containing the complete text of the Nevi'im (Prophets) section of the Hebrew Bible. Traditionally believed to be the oldest dated Hebrew Codex of the Bible in existence, recent research suggests it may actually date from the 11th century, rather than the year 895 CE as indicated in its colophon. The codex includes the books of the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) and Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets), totaling 575 pages, which include 13 carpet pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to its colophon, the codex was written with punctuation by Moses ben Asher in Tiberias, at the end of the year 827 after the destruction of the Second Temple. This corresponds to the year 895 CE, during the reign of Al-Mu'tadid. Originally a gift to the Karaite community in Jerusalem, the codex was taken as booty by Crusaders in 1099. It was later redeemed and came into the possession of the Karaite community in Cairo. In 1983, as the Karaite Jews departed Egypt, they entrusted the Codex Cairensis to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It is currently securely stored in a special room beneath the Hebrew Manuscript collection. The Codex's journey back to Jerusalem was undertaken by a committee of six individuals, marking its return to the city after centuries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Codex Cairensis is of immense historical and textual significance, offering insights into the medieval Hebrew text of the Prophets. Its journey through time, from Tiberias to Jerusalem, then to Cairo, and back to Jerusalem, reflects the turbulent history of the Hebrew manuscripts and the communities that preserved them. This codex remains a crucial artifact for biblical scholars, particularly those interested in the textual traditions of the Hebrew Bible.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"23","iso":"hbo","year":895,"type":"manuscript","provider":"Makor Publishing LTD.","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HBOCAIR_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(0895)-Cairo-Codex-(facsimilie)","language":{"iso":"hbo","glotto_id":"anci1244","name":"Ancient Hebrew","autonym":"עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית","level":"H","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.77607,"longitude":35.17248,"status_id":"9"}}
