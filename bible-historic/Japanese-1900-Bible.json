{"id":"Japanese-1900-Bible","abbr":"JPNKYZ","title":"Japanese (1900) Bible","title_vernacular":"日本語 - 聖書 (1900)","description":"The 1900 Japanese Bible marks a significant milestone in the dissemination of Christian Scriptures in Japan. With a population of approximately 128 million, Japan's linguistic landscape is complex, with Japanese being part of the Japonic language family. Despite the influence from China and various theories about its linguistic origins, Japanese developed its own unique script system combining Chinese characters (kanji) and phonetic symbols (kana). Christianity's history in Japan began in 1549 with the arrival of Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier, along with initial translations of New Testament texts. However, after a brief period of missionary activity, Christianity faced suppression until the 19th century when Protestant missionaries reintroduced the Bible in Japanese. The publication of the Bible in 1900 represents the culmination of efforts to make the Christian Scriptures accessible to the Japanese people, reflecting a significant cultural and religious integration process.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"878","iso":"jpn","year":1900,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"Internet Archive","archive_id":"JPNKYZ_DBS_HS/Japanese-(1900)-Bible","language":{"iso":"jpn","glotto_id":"nucl1643","iso1":"ja","name":"Japanese","autonym":"日本語","level":"L","location":"Japan","area":"Widespread.
