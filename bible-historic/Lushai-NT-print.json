{"id":"Lushai-NT-print","abbr":"LUSBIV","title":"Lushai - NT (Print)","title_vernacular":"Lushai Thukhuma Bu","description":"The Mizo language, or Mizo ṭawng, is a Kuki-Chin-Mizo language belonging to the Tibeto-Burman family of languages, spoken natively by the Mizo people in the Mizoram state of India and Chin State in Myanmar. The language is also known as Duhlian and Lushai, a colonial term, as the Duhlian people were the first among the Mizos to be encountered by the British in the course of their colonial expansion. The Mizo language is mainly based on the Lusei dialect but it has also derived many words from its surrounding Mizo sub-tribes and sub-clan. Now, Mizo language or Mizo ṭawng is the lingua franca of Mizoram and its surrounding areas and to a lesser extent of Myanmar and Bangladesh and in India in some parts of Assam, Tripura, and Manipur. Many poetic languages are derived from Pawi, Paite, and Hmar, and most known ancient poems considered to be Mizo are actually in Pawi. Mizo is the official language of Mizoram, along with English, and there have been efforts to have it included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"2","iso":"lus","year":2005,"type":"book","provider":"Waterlow \u0026 Sons Limited","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LUSBIV_DBS_HS/Lushai-NT-(print)","language":{"iso":"lus","glotto_id":"lush1249","name":"Lushai","autonym":"Mizo ṭawng","level":"L","location":"Bangladesh","area":"Mizoram; Assam; Manipur, Churachandpur District; Nagaland; Tripura, Jampui Hill range.
