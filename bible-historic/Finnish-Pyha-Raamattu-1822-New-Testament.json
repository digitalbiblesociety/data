Fen-land (meaning the ‘land of marshes’, - the Finns call it Suomi) was settled in the 8th century A.D. by the Finns, who forced the original Lapp population to move northward. In the 12th century, Finland was dominated and Christianized by Swedes, which made Swedish the official and literary language. The area passed by stages to Russia (1721 - 1809), but during the early 19th century a growing nationalist movement resulted in constituting Finnish as the national language (1863) and establishing the Finnish Republic in 1919. Finnish is placed in the Finnic group of the Uralian languages, which includes such tongues as Estonian, Livonian, Karelian, and Vcpse. More distantly related within the Uralian family are the Lapp, Mordvin, Cheremiss, Vogul, Votiak, and Hungarian (Ugric) languages.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"34","iso":"fin","year":1822,"type":"scan","provider":"American Bible Society","org_id":"american-bible-society","digitizer":"","archive_id":"FINBPR_DBS_HS/Finnish-Pyha-Raamattu-(1822)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"fin","glotto_id":"finn1318","iso1":"fi","name":"Finnish","autonym":"suomen kieli","level":"L","location":"Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden","area":"Also in Canada, Estonia, Norway, Russian Federation (Europe), Sweden, United States.","country_id":"FI","latitude":64.762825,"longitude":25.55767,"population":5770040,"status_id":"1"}}
