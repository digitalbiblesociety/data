{"id":"Albanian-1912-Exodus-TeDalete","abbr":"SQIALB","title":"Albanian (1912) Exodus ","title_vernacular":"Shqip (1912) Eksodi","description":"The Albanian translation of the Book of Exodus, completed in 1912 by the Massachusetts Bible Society, marks a significant development in the religious and cultural landscape of the Albanian-speaking community. The Book of Exodus, one of the foundational texts of the Old Testament, narrates the story of Moses, the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, and their journey through the wilderness. This narrative has been pivotal in shaping Judeo-Christian theology and ethics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe translation of this key biblical book into Albanian was an essential step in making the Scriptures accessible to Albanian speakers. It reflects the Massachusetts Bible Society's dedication to spreading Christian teachings across linguistic barriers. This effort not only brought the spiritual and ethical lessons of Exodus to a new audience but also enriched the Albanian language with a religious text of profound significance. The translation would have played a crucial role in the spiritual life of Albanian Christians, offering them insights into the history and beliefs of their faith in their native tongue. Additionally, this translation project helped in preserving and promoting the Albanian language and culture, contributing to a sense of national identity among its speakers. The 1912 Albanian translation of Exodus thus represents both a religious milestone and a cultural achievement, bridging the gap between ancient biblical traditions and the modern Albanian-speaking world.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"6","iso":"sqi","year":1912,"type":"scan","provider":"Treg Nerkomgetare","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"SQIALB_DBS_HS/Albanian-(1912)-Exodus-(TeDalete)","language":{"iso":"sqi","glotto_id":"sqi","iso1":"sq","name":"Albanian","autonym":"shqip","level":"L","country_id":"AL","population":5878700}}
