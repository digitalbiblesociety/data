Godeau's work is recognized for balancing between a direct translation and paraphrase, offering a unique take on the scriptures. Nicolas Legros later published an anonymous translation in Cologne, 1739, which, when reissued with his name, faced criticism from prominent Catholic figures like Bossuet and Cardinal de Noailles for alleged Socinian tendencies. This edition highlights the complexities of translating sacred texts in a period marked by religious and doctrinal scrutiny.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"80","iso":"fra","year":1839,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"Google","archive_id":"FRAOST_DBS_HS/French-(1839)-New-Testament-(Antoine-Eugene-Genoude)","language":{"iso":"fra","glotto_id":"stan1290","iso1":"fr","name":"French","autonym":"français","level":"L","location":"Andorra and France","area":"Also in Algeria, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, French Guiana, French Polynesia, Gabon, Guadeloupe, Guinea, Haiti, India, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mali, Martinique, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, Monaco, Morocco, Mozambique, New Caledonia, Niger, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Réunion, Rwanda, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna.","country_id":"FR","latitude":48,"longitude":2,"population":77200000,"status_id":"1"}}
