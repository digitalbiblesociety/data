{"id":"Russian-1860-Mark-WDL-19270","abbr":"RUSOLD","title":"Russian (1860) Mark (WDL-19270)","title_vernacular":"От Марка святое благовествование","description":"The 1860 Russian edition of the Gospel according to Saint Mark, cataloged as WDL-19270, represents a unique linguistic and cultural intersection. It is written in a native Alaskan language, transliterated into Cyrillic script, a practice common among Russian Orthodox missionaries in Alaska who frequently translated religious texts for local communities. These missionaries established their first North American mission on Kodiak Island in 1794, expanding to the Aleutian Islands and mainland, with Novoarkhangelsk (now Sitka) as a key location. Their work included not just translations but also compiling dictionaries of local languages using Cyrillic script, which are now valuable historical documents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA notable aspect of this Gospel version is the note on its last page, indicating that it was returned to the library at Unalaska by Jay Ellis Ransom, a well-known mid-20th-century journalist and anthropologist with a focus on Alaska. The blending of native Alaskan languages with Cyrillic script in religious texts illustrates the Russian Orthodox Church’s efforts to integrate with local cultures while spreading Christianity in Alaska.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/19270","filesize":"49","iso":"rus","year":1860,"type":"scan","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"RUSOLD_DBS_HS/Russian-(1860)-Mark-(WDL-19270)","language":{"iso":"rus","glotto_id":"russ1263","iso1":"ru","name":"Russian","autonym":"русский язык","level":"L","location":"China","country_id":"RU","latitude":53.919516,"longitude":72.392575,"population":154000000,"status_id":"1"}}
