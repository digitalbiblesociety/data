{"id":"Urdu-1870-Psalms-Dua-i-amim-ki-kitab-aur-sakraminton-ki-tartib","abbr":"URDOLD","title":"Urdu (1870) Psalms","title_vernacular":"اردو (1870) زبور","description":"The Urdu (1870) Psalms edition was a significant milestone in making the Bible accessible to Urdu-speaking populations in South Asia, particularly in regions now known as Pakistan and India. Urdu, a language rich in Arabic and Persian loanwords, serves as a lingua franca across these areas, making this translation vital for religious study and dissemination. This edition was part of a broader effort, spearheaded by the North India Auxiliary Bible Society in Mirsapore, to translate the Bible into Urdu, leveraging the work of R. C. Mather and based on previous translations by C. T. Hoernle. A slightly revised text was also prepared in Arabic characters by H. U. Weitbrecht for the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) in 1887, indicating the ongoing evolution and adaptation of Biblical texts to meet the linguistic and cultural needs of Urdu speakers. This work underscores the dynamic process of Bible translation in colonial India, reflecting both the linguistic diversity of the region and the complex interplay between local and foreign religious influences.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"17","iso":"urd","year":1870,"type":"scan","provider":"Secundra Orphanage Press","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"URDOLD_DBS_HS/Urdu-(1870)-Psalms-(Dua-i-amim-ki-kitab-aur-sakraminton-ki-tartib)","language":{"iso":"urd","glotto_id":"urdu1245","iso1":"ur","name":"Urdu","autonym":"اُردُو","level":"L","location":"Bangladesh","area":"Widespread.
