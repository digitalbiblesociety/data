{"id":"Dari-New-Testament-book","abbr":"PRSTDV","title":"Dari - New Testament (Book)","title_vernacular":"دری عهد جدید (کتاب)","description":"Dari, also known as Dari Persian, is a variety of the Persian language spoken in Afghanistan. Dari is the term officially recognized and promoted since 1964 by the Afghan government for the Persian language, hence it is known as Afghan Persian or Eastern Persian in many Western sources. As Professor Nile Green remarks \"the impulses behind the renaming of Afghan Persian as Dari were more nationalistic than linguistic\" in order to create an Afghan state narrative. Apart from a few basics of vocabulary, there is little difference between the formal written Persian of Afghanistan and Iran. The term \"Dari\" is officially used for the characteristic spoken Persian of Afghanistan but is best restricted to formal spoken registers. Persian-speakers in Afghanistan prefer to still call their language “Farsi,” while Pashto-speakers may sometimes refer to it as \"Parsi.\" Farsi Dari serves as the lingua franca for inter-ethnic communications in Afghanistan.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"17","iso":"prs","year":2008,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"PRSTDV_DBS_HS/Dari-New-Testament-(book)","language":{"iso":"prs","glotto_id":"dari1249","name":"Dari","autonym":"دری","level":"L","location":"Afghanistan","area":"Provinces of Herat, Hazarajat, Balkh, Ghor, Ghazni, Budaksham, Panjsher; Galcha-Pamir Mountains; Kabul regions.
