{"id":"Iroquois-1880-Gospels","abbr":"MOHFGM","title":"Iroquois (1880) Gospels","title_vernacular":"Iroquois (1880) Hadisohneka","description":"The Iroquois Indians were actually a league of five, later six, Indian Nations: the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca (and, after 1722, Tuscarora) tribes. The democratically conducted Iroquoian Confederacy was established by Hiawatha. Firm allies of the British during the early days of the American Colonial Era, the Iroquois, from a home in New York State, took control of almost all the northeast-central region of the present-day United States. There are now about 15,000 Indians of these tribes living on reservations in the United States and in Quebec and Ontario, Canada.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe closely related languages of the Iroquois tribes are grouped in the Iroquoian language family, with the tongues of the Huron, Erie, Conestoga, and Cherokee. The Pawnee, Arikara, and Wichita languages of the Caddo group are also sometimes included.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Scriptures might well be considered to be Mohawk, although they differ slightly in vocabulary and orthography from those used for Mohawk since they represent an attempt to provide a common Mohawk-Oneida usage. A prayer book with Scripture Selections translated by Solomon Davis was published in the Oneida language (1837, Swords, Standord \u0026 Co., New York).","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"16","iso":"moh","year":1880,"type":"scan","provider":"John Lovell \u0026 Son-The British and Foreign Bible Society","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MOHFGM_DBS_HS/Iroquois-(1880)-Gospels","language":{"iso":"moh","glotto_id":"moha1258","name":"Mohawk","autonym":"KanienʼkéhaKanyenʼkéha","level":"L","location":"Canada","area":"Southwest Quebec, south Ontario.
