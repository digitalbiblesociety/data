(WDL-21767)","description":"The Codex Aureus Anthimi, also known as Codex of Berat number 2 (Gregory-Aland no. 1143), is a Byzantine manuscript from around 867 AD, renowned for its artistic and historical significance. This ninth-century manuscript contains the four Gospels, written in Greek minuscule letters with golden ink on purple parchment, which has since faded to a yellowish-green hue. It is notable for its one-column format, featuring 17 lines per page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat sets this manuscript apart are its four gold miniatures of the Evangelists, making it an exceptional surviving artifact from its era. It is believed to have been copied in an imperial scriptorium either in Constantinople or along the shores of Asia Minor during the Macedonian Renaissance. The manuscript's journey to Berat, south-central Albania, where it was present since 1356, remains undocumented. It endured through significant historical upheavals, including being hidden during the Communist regime's anti-religious campaigns in Albania after World War II. Rediscovered in 1968, it was severely threatened by humidity before being restored in Beijing in 1971, under an agreement with the Academy of Sciences of China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its return to Albania in January 1972, the Codex Aureus Anthimi has been preserved at the Central State Archive of Albania in Tirana. The manuscript, alongside the sixth-century Codex Beratinus Purpureus Phi, was recognized as a unique treasure for humanity and inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005. Its embossed metal plate covers, produced in 1805, were likely added during a restoration in that period, adding to its historical and aesthetic value.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/21766","filesize":"115","iso":"grc","year":867,"type":"manuscript","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GRCAURE_DBS_HS/Greek-(0867-ca.)-Codex-Aureus-Anthimi-Gospels-(WDL-21767)","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
