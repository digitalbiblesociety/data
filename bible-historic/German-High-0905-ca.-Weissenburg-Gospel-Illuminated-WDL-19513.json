Otfried, a student of Rabanus Maurus, innovatively introduced end rhyme into Old High German poetry through this work, which is essentially a metrical Gospel harmony drawing from all four Gospels to recount the life of Christ in the southern Rhine Franconian dialect. This manuscript, a counterpart to the Old Saxon Heliand, is divided into five books plus a prologue, showcasing the narrative in a harmonized form. Copied on 125 parchment leaves in 902‒5 in Freising by order of Bishop Waldo, the manuscript evidences the transition from Carolingian minuscule to the 10th-century script, with a unique column layout and red initials marking the beginning of odd-numbered lines. After disappearing during the secularization of Freising Cathedral Library in 1803, it was rediscovered a year later in the cathedral archives and subsequently transferred to the Munich Court Library, the precursor to today’s Bavarian State Library, preserving a key piece of Germanic Christian heritage and literary history.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/19508","filesize":"85","iso":"goh","year":905,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Freising, Germany","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GOHWEIS_DBS_HS/German-High-(0905-ca.)-Weissenburg-Gospel-Illuminated-(WDL-19513)","language":{"iso":"goh","glotto_id":"oldh1241","name":"Old High German (ca. 750-1050)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
