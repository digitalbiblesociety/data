The 1837 edition marks the first American publication of this historic translation, featuring an introduction by J.A. Dabney. This edition is significant as it represents a key moment in the dissemination of the Bible in English, particularly in America. It's a part of the wider historical context of making religious texts more accessible to the general public, a movement in which William Tyndale was a pivotal figure. His 1526 translation laid the foundation for subsequent English translations of the Bible, including the King James Version.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"70","iso":"eng","year":1837,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGTYN_DBS_HS/English-(1837)-Tyndales-New-Testament-(1526-version)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
