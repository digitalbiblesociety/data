{"id":"Kikongo-Genesis-print","abbr":"KNGPOR","title":"Kikongo - Genesis (Print)","title_vernacular":"Kikongo Tangila (Genesis)","description":"Kongo or Kikongo is one of the Bantu languages spoken by the Kongo people living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Angola. It is a tonal language. It was spoken by many of those who were taken from the region and sold as slaves in the Americas. For this reason, while Kongo still is spoken in the above-mentioned countries, creolized forms of the language are found in ritual speech of Afro-American religions, especially in Brazil, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is also one of the sources of the Gullah language[4] and the Palenquero creole in Colombia. The vast majority of present-day speakers live in Africa. There are roughly seven million native speakers of Kongo, with perhaps two million more who use it as a second language.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"1","iso":"kng","year":1994,"type":"book","provider":"Congo KiKongo Bible","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"KNGPOR_DBS_HS/Kikongo-Genesis-(print)","language":{"iso":"kng","glotto_id":"koon1244","name":"Koongo","autonym":"Kikongo","level":"L","location":"Angola","area":"Bas-Congo Province cataract, Mbanza Manteke area; Fioti north of Boma, and scattered along Congo River from Brazzaville to its mouth.
