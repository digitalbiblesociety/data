Yabem belongs to the division of the Melanesian languages spoken natively (in 1978) by about 2,000 people at Finschhafen, which is on the southern tip of the Huon Peninsula in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea, despite historical evidence that shows that the language originated in the northern coast. However, Yabem was adopted as local lingua franca along with Kâte for evangelical and educational purposes by the German Lutheran missionaries who first arrived at Simbang, a Yabem-speaking village, in 1885. Yabem was the first language for which the missionaries created a writing system because it was the first language that they encountered when they arrived.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"184","iso":"jae","year":1980,"type":"genesis","provider":"The Bible Society of Papua New Guinea","org_id":"bible-society-of-papua-new-guinea","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"JAEYHB_DBS_HS/Yabem-(1980)-Genesis-Portion-(Bibolo-Dabun)","language":{"iso":"jae","glotto_id":"yabe1254","name":"Yabem","autonym":"Jabêm","level":"L","location":"Papua New Guinea, Map 11","area":"Morobe Province, Huon Peninsula, near Finschhafen coast.","country_id":"PG","latitude":-6.67052,"longitude":147.80997,"population":2080,"status_id":"5"}}
