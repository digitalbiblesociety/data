This four-volume encyclopedic work is an extraordinary blend of biblical exegesis, scientific observation, and artistic craftsmanship, aiming to reconcile the natural sciences with divine creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScheuchzer sought to demonstrate the harmony between science and Scripture, interpreting natural phenomena through a biblical lens. Each page of the Physica Sacra presents a Bible passage, accompanied by scientific commentary and exquisite copperplate engravings (Kupferstiche) that visually interpret the natural world in relation to biblical events. These detailed illustrations were created by some of the most skilled artists of the time and remain a defining feature of the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe engraved illustrations cover a vast range of topics, including astronomy, meteorology, zoology, botany, and geology, all linked to biblical references. Some of the most striking images include the Great Flood, the Tower of Babel, the Plagues of Egypt, and depictions of the animal kingdom and celestial phenomena. These illustrations reflect the Baroque fascination with both religious symbolism and scientific discovery, making the Physica Sacra a unique fusion of faith and empirical knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Latin-language encyclopedia, this work was intended for an educated audience, including theologians, scientists, and scholars of the 18th-century Enlightenment. Though Scheuchzer's interpretations were deeply rooted in biblical literalism, his meticulous scientific observations contributed to early studies in paleontology, meteorology, and natural history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, the Physica Sacra is considered an important historical document, reflecting the intellectual climate of the 18th century, when scholars attempted to merge scientific discoveries with religious doctrine. It stands as a testament to the era’s artistic, scientific, and theological endeavors, preserving a vision of a world where nature and Scripture were seen as intertwined expressions of divine wisdom.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"1","iso":"lat","year":1733,"type":"illuminated","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
