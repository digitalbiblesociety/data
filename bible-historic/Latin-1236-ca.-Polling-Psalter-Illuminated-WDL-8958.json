Polling Psalter - Illuminated (WDL-8958)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginating from southwestern Germany after 1235, the Polling Psalter was preserved for a long time in the Polling monastery in Upper Bavaria before being added to the Bavarian State Library collections. This psalter is particularly notable for its extensive cycle of biblical scenes preceding the psalter text. The narrative begins with four illustrations from Adam and Eve's life, followed by New Testament scenes starting with the Annunciation and culminating in a Majestas domini (Glory of the Lord) surrounded by symbols of the evangelists. Striking features include Christ descending to hell and the king of hell in chains. The psalter text is interspersed with lavish initials in bright gouache opaque watercolors on a gold background, framed elaborately. The complexity and vivacity of the initial at the psalter's beginning, with its human-figured tendrils, are particularly remarkable. This manuscript is a significant example of medieval illumination, showcasing the artistic and religious sensibilities of its time.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8958","filesize":"136","iso":"lat","year":1236,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATPOLL_DBS_HS/Latin-(1236-ca.)-Polling-Psalter-Illuminated-(WDL-8958)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
