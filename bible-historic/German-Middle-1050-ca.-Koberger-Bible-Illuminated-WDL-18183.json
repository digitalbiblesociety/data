Koberger Bible - Illuminated (WDL-18183)","title_vernacular":"Koberger Bibel (1050 ca., Illuminiert) (WDL-18183)","description":"The Koberger Bible, printed in 1483 by Anton Koberger in Nuremberg, Germany, represents a significant milestone in the history of printed Bibles. As the ninth German-language Bible and the second produced in Nuremberg, it followed the earlier Mentelin Bible of 1466 and the Sensenschmidt Bible of circa 1476–78. Koberger, known for his substantial contributions to early printing, borrowed woodcuts from a 1478–79 Cologne edition by Bartholomaeus of Unckel, which he had co-financed, to enrich his Bible's decoration. This edition is particularly noted for its first woodcut of Eve's creation, extensive use of painted initials for rubrication or illumination, and over 70 initial letters adorned in tempera, gold, or silver with acanthus-leaf patterns marking the start of biblical books and apostolic letters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe craftsmanship in the Koberger Bible, with its lavish decoration and integration of figures such as prophets and angels into the initials, indicates the skill of artists trained in the school of Johann Bämler in Augsburg. Despite similarities with decorations in a 1490 manuscript in the Austrian National Library, the exact location of the illuminator's work—Augsburg or Nuremberg—requires further research. The Württembergische Landesbibliothek's copy, illuminated by a different artist likely commissioned by Koberger in Nuremberg, underscores the diversity and richness of the artistic collaboration in early printed Bibles. This Bible not only exemplifies the evolution of printing and illumination techniques but also highlights the cultural and religious significance of disseminating biblical texts during the Renaissance.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/4106","filesize":"289","iso":"gmh","year":1050,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Anton Koberger, Nuremberg","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GMHKOBE_DBS_HS/German-Middle-(1050-ca.)-Koberger-Bible-Illuminated-(WDL-18183)","language":{"iso":"gmh","glotto_id":"midd1343","name":"Middle High German (ca. 1050-1500)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
