Carrow Psalter - Illuminated (WDL-13005)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Carrow Psalter, an English manuscript from the mid-13th century, was created in East Anglia. It was named after its later use by the Carrow nunnery near Norwich. This psalter-hours contains the Office of the Dead and the Hours of the Virgin, among other texts, and features a special emphasis on Saint Olaf, highlighted in the Beatus initial of Psalm 1. The manuscript is renowned for its diverse illuminations, which include full-page depictions of saints, martyrs, and biblical scenes, as well as historiated initials within the psalter. Additionally, 15th-century heraldry was added to previously undecorated initials in the Hours of the Virgin. A notable inclusion is the miniature on folio 15 verso, which depicts the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket. In an interesting historical twist, after Henry VIII posthumously condemned Becket for treason in 1538, Becket's image was obscured by gluing a page over it, rather than destroying it. This concealed image has since been rediscovered, adding to the manuscript's historical and artistic significance.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13005","filesize":"80","iso":"lat","year":1250,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Ex Muaeo Henrici Yates Thompson","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATCARR_DBS_HS/Latin-(1250-ca.)-Carrow-Psalter-Illuminated-(WDL-13005)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
