Noted by de Soto as early as 1540, the Creeks were friendly to the English against the Spanish, but they were led by the Shawnee prophet Tecumseh to rise against the British in the Creek War of 1813. The entire people was finally moved to Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Also relocated in Indian Territory were many of the Seminoles, Florida Indians who had absorbed considerable numbers of Creek refugees from the north, and had become linguistically assimilated to the related Creek language. The Creeks and Seminoles came to be included within the Five Civilized Tribes. There are now about 17,000 Creek Indians and 2,500 Seminoles in Oklahoma. About 1,000 Seminoles still live in comparative isolation in the Everglades of Florida.\u003cbr\u003eThe related dialects of these tribes and the Creek-influenced Seminole tongue (the Seminoles originally spoke a language known as Mikasuki) are usually known as Muskogee. The Muskogee were the dominant tribe of the Creek Confederacy, and the term has since come to denote the entire linguistic family to which the Creek, Seminole, Choctaw, Apalachee, Natchez, Hitchiti (Mikasuki), and related Indian languages pertain.\u003cbr\u003e1835 John Shawanoe Baptist Mission, Indian Territory Translated by Johnathan Lykins and John Davis, Creek Baptists.\u003cbr\u003e1855 Matthew Park Hill, Indian Territory\u003cbr\u003eTranslated by Robert M.
