Published in Venice between 1524 and 1525 by Daniel Bomberg, this volume is part of a classic printing of the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Hebrew Masoretic text. The Mikraot Gedolot is noted for its historical importance, particularly because it is believed to have been the source text (Textus Receptus) for the Hebrew Old Testament used by the translators of the King James Version of the Bible in 1611.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJacob ben Haim, a Jewish Masoretic scholar who later converted to Christianity, was responsible for producing and editing the Mikraot Gedolot. His work represents a monumental achievement in the early days of the printing press. The meticulous assembly of Hebrew letters, vowels, and accents in this edition was an arduous and technologically challenging process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBen Hayyim used the best Hebrew manuscripts available to him at the time, and while there has been some debate over the quality of these manuscripts, the renowned Masoretic scholar Ginsburg has argued that the Mikraot Gedolot was a good representation of the Ben Asher text. Ginsburg's own respected editions of the Hebrew Bible, printed by the British and Foreign Bible Society, were based on ben Hayyim's Second Rabbinic Bible, further underscoring the lasting impact and importance of this work in the field of Hebrew biblical scholarship.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"280","iso":"heb","year":1524,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HEBRABB_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1524)-The-Second-Rabbinic-Bible-(Mikraot-Gedolot)-Volume-3","language":{"iso":"heb","glotto_id":"hebr1245","iso1":"he","name":"Hebrew","autonym":"Israeli Hebrew","level":"L","area":"Also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, Panama, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.10565,"longitude":35.01788,"population":5000000,"status_id":"1"}}
