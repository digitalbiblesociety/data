It belongs to the Micronesian branch of the Oceanic languages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe word Kiribati, the current name of the islands, is the local adaptation of the previous European name \"Gilberts\" to Gilbertese phonology. Early European visitors, including Commodore John Byron, whose ships happened on Nikunau in 1765, had named some of the islands the Kingsmill or Kings Mill Islands or for the Northern group les îles Mulgrave in French but in 1820 they were renamed, in French, les îles Gilbert by Admiral Adam Johann von Krusenstern, after Captain Thomas Gilbert, who, along with Captain John Marshall, had passed through some of these islands in 1788. Frequenting of the islands by Europeans, Americans, and Chinese dates from whaling and oil trading from the 1820s, when no doubt Europeans learned to speak it, as Gilbertese learned to speak English and other languages foreign to them. The first ever vocabulary list of Gilbertese was published by the French Revue coloniale (1847) by an auxiliary surgeon on corvette Le Rhin in 1845. His warship took on board a drift Gilbertese of Kuria, that they found near Tabiteuea. However, it was not until Hiram Bingham II took up missionary work on Abaiang in the 1860s that the language began to take on the written form known now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBingham was the first to translate the Bible into Gilbertese, and wrote several hymn books, a dictionary (1908, posthumous) and commentaries in the language of the Gilbert Islands. Alphonse Colomb, a French priest in Tahiti wrote in 1888, Vocabulaire arorai (îles Gilbert) précédé de notes grammaticales d'après un manuscrit du P. Latium Levêque et le travail de Hale sur la langue Tarawa / par le P. A. C.. Father Levêque named the Gilbertese Arorai (from Arorae) when Horatio Hale called them Tarawa. This work was also based on the first known description of Gilbertese in English, published in 1846, in the volume Ethnology and Philology of the U.S. Exploring Expedition, compiled by Horatio Hale.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"2","iso":"gil","year":1866,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GILBPG_DBS_HS/Gilbertese-(1866)-Matthew-(Taetae-ne-Kirbati-Mataio)","language":{"iso":"gil","glotto_id":"gilb1244","name":"Gilbertese","autonym":"Kiribati","level":"L","location":"Solomon Islands","area":"Also in Fiji, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, United States, Vanuatu.","country_id":"KI","latitude":0.64049,"longitude":173.219604,"population":118620,"status_id":"1"}}
