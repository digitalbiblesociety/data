It is the primary language of the Ixil people, which mainly comprises the three towns of San Juan Cotzal, Santa Maria Nebaj, and San Gaspar Chajul in the Guatemalan highlands and numerous towns in the states of Campeche and Quintana Roo in southeast México. There is also an Ixil-speaking migrant population in Guatemala City, Mexico City, and the United States. Although there are slight differences in vocabulary in the dialects spoken by people in the three main Guatemalan Ixil towns, they are all mutually intelligible and should be considered dialects of a single language. According to historical linguistic studies Ixil emerged as a separate language sometime around the year 500AD.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"4","iso":"ixl","year":2008,"type":"book","provider":"Wycliffe Bible Translators-Liga Biblica Internacional","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"","archive_id":"IXLWBN_DBS_HS/Ixil-Nebaj-(2008)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"ixl","glotto_id":"ixil1254","name":"Ixil","autonym":"Ixil, San Juan Cotzal","level":"L","location":"Guatemala","area":"Municipality of Cotzal, Quiché Department.","country_id":"GT","latitude":15.45693,"longitude":-90.89351,"population":115000,"status_id":"4"}}
