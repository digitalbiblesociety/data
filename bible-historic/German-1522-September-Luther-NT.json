This translation, harmonizing with Gutenberg's printing press, marked a pivotal shift in German religious, linguistic, and social landscapes. Luther's version, first fully published in 1534, translated from Greek, offered greater accuracy than prior Vulgate translations and laid the groundwork for a unified German language across diverse dialects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe unique codex of this Bible, housed at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland, boasts full-page woodcuts by Lucas Cranach and was owned by Johann Gramann, Lutherâ€™s contemporary and supporter, known as the \"Apostle of Prussia.\" This particular copy is notable for Gramann's extensive marginal notes, many derived from his discussions with Luther, offering a rare and personal insight into the Reformation era and Luther's influence.","description_vernacular":"German-1522-September-Luther-NT.jpg","ref":"","iso":"deu","dt":1522,"tp":"book","pro":"","dg":"","aid":"DEUL45_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","level":"L","location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"DE","latitude":48.648954,"longitude":12.467623,"population":76100000,"status_id":"1","bibles":null,"films":null,"resources":null}}
