It belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family, but its position is unclear. Grierson (1903) classified it under Naga languages, Shafer (1974) and Bradley (1997) classify the Mikir languages as an aberrant Kuki-Chin branch, but Thurgood (2003) leaves them unclassified within Sino-Tibetan. Blench and Post (2013) classify it as one of the most basal languages of the entire family.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"174","iso":"mjw","year":2010,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MJWBSI_DBS_HS/Karbi-John-(book)","language":{"iso":"mjw","glotto_id":"karb1241","name":"Karbi","autonym":"Arleng","level":"L","location":"India, Map 5","area":"Assam, Karbi Anglong District, Mikir and Rengma hills, Nagaon, Darrang, Marigaon, Sonitpur, Lakhimpur, North Cachar districts; Arunachal Pradesh, Papumpare District, Balijan circle; Meghalaya, Jaintia District; Nagaland, foothills around Dimapur.","country_id":"IN","latitude":25.7317,"longitude":93.04624,"population":529000,"status_id":"5"}}
