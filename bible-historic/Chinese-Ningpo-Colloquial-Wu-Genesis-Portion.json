{"id":"Chinese-Ningpo-Colloquial-Wu-Genesis-Portion","abbr":"WUUNNT","title":"Chinese Ningpo Colloquial Wu Genesis Portion","title_vernacular":"創世記部分","description":"The Chinese Ningpo Colloquial Wu Genesis Portion represents an early effort to translate the Bible into the local dialects of China, specifically targeting the Ningpo area in the Wu-speaking region. This translation focused on the first four chapters of Genesis, marking a significant step towards making biblical texts accessible to the Ningpo-speaking population. Published by the British and Foreign Bible Society, this work is an example of the broader missionary efforts to localize Christian scriptures, aiming to foster a deeper understanding and acceptance of Christianity within diverse linguistic and cultural contexts in China. By adapting the Genesis narrative to the Ningpo colloquial, the translators sought to bridge the gap between the universal messages of the Bible and the particular linguistic nuances of the Chinese dialects, thereby enhancing the scripture's relevance and resonance with the local populace.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"317","iso":"wuu","year":1897,"type":"genesis","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"WUUNNT_DBS_HS/Chinese-Ningpo-Colloquial-Wu-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"wuu","glotto_id":"wuch1236","name":"Wu Chinese","autonym":"吳語/吴语","level":"L","location":"China","area":"Jiangsu south of Changjiang River, east of Zhenjiang, on Chongming Island, mouth of the Changjiang, and north of the Changjiang in the area around Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Qingjiang; Zhejiang Province south to Quzhou, Jinhua, and Wenzhou.
