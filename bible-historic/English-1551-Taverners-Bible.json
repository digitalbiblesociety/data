{"id":"English-1551-Taverners-Bible","abbr":"ENGTVB","title":"English (1551) Taverners Bible","title_vernacular":"","description":"Taverner's Bible, more accurately titled The Most Sacred Bible whiche is the holy scripture, conteyning the old and new testament, translated into English, and newly recognized with great diligence after most faythful exemplars by Rychard Taverner, is a revision of Matthew's Bible. Edited by Richard Taverner, it was first published in 1539, and its first editions are considered extremely rare today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe emergence of Taverner's Bible posed a commercial threat to the successful sale of Matthew's Bible, initially a private venture by printers Grafton and Whitchurch. Taverner's version, published in 1539 in folio (Herbert #45) by \"John Byddell for Thomas Barthlet\", represented a form of \"piracy,\" as it was essentially Grafton's Matthew Bible revised by Taverner. Taverner, known as a learned member of the Inner Temple and a renowned Greek scholar, introduced numerous changes to the Matthew Bible. These alterations were marked by his critical insight and a preference for strong, idiomatic expressions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite these revisions, Taverner's Bible did not significantly influence subsequent translations. Only a few phrases from this version found their way into the later King James Bible. As summarized by Daniell, Taverner's Bible was \"indeed a version which had no influence,\" highlighting its limited impact on the evolution of English Bible translations.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"502","iso":"eng","year":1551,"type":"scan","provider":"GreatSite.com","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGTVB_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
