This volume, along with the rest of the set, was a monumental achievement in the history of printing and biblical scholarship, illustrating the height of Spanish typographic artistry of the 16th century. The effort to compile and print this work involved a significant collaboration among scholars and experts in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic, under the printing expertise of Arnaldo Guillén de Brocar. This volume is particularly notable for containing linguistic resources that were invaluable to scholars of the time, including a Hebrew and Aramaic dictionary, a Hebrew grammar, and a Greek dictionary. The creation of new and highly perfected typefaces for each language set a new standard in printing. Despite the challenges and the time-consuming process, the completion and subsequent distribution of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible in 1520, after papal authorization, marked a significant advancement in academic study, providing an essential resource for the comparative study of biblical texts.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10636","filesize":"117","iso":"aii","year":1514,"type":"study","provider":"Arnao Guillén de Brocar, Alcalá de Henares","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"AII1514_DBS_HS/Aramaic-(1514)-Complutensian-Polyglot-Bible-(Vol-5-of-5)-Grk-Heb-Lat-Aramaic-Study(WDL-10636)","language":{"iso":"aii","glotto_id":"assy1241","name":"Assyrian Neo-Aramaic","autonym":"Sūreṯ","level":"L","location":"Iraq","area":"Northern Iraq, Baghdad, Basrah, Karkuk, Arbil.
