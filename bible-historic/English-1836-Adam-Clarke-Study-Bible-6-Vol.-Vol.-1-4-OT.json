He is most renowned for his comprehensive Bible commentary, a work that took 40 years to complete and became a foundational theological resource for Methodists for two centuries. The commentary is notable for its detail and erudition. Clarke, a committed Wesleyan, opposed Calvinistic interpretations, favoring Wesleyan-Arminian views on salvation, predestination, prevenient grace, the universal offer of justification, the possibility of entire sanctification, and the assurance of salvation. His commentary, especially on the Book of Revelation, controversially identified the Catholic Church with the Antichrist. Clarke's work, almost half the volume of the collaborative twelve-volume The Interpreter's Bible, is recognized for its academic depth.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"650","iso":"eng","year":1836,"type":"study","provider":"G.
