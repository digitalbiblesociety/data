Linguistically, Karelian is closely related to the Finnish dialects spoken in eastern Finland, and some Finnish linguists have even classified Karelian as a dialect of Finnish, though in the modern day it is widely considered a separate language. Karelian is not to be confused with the Southeastern dialects of Finnish, sometimes referred to as karjalaismurteet (\"Karelian dialects\") in Finland.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"346","iso":"krl","year":2003,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"KRLNEW_DBS_HS/Karelian-John-(print)","language":{"iso":"krl","glotto_id":"kare1335","name":"Karelian","autonym":"karjal kariela  karjala","level":"L","location":"Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden","area":"Karelia, Tver (Kalinin), St. Petersburg, and Murmansk Oblasts.
