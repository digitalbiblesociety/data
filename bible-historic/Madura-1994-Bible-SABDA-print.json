It was traditionally written in the Javanese script, but the Latin script and the Pegon script (based on Arabic script) is now more commonly used. The number of speakers, though shrinking, is estimated to be 8–13 million, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in the country. Bawean Madurese, which is a dialect of Madurese, is also spoken by Baweanese descendants in Malaysia and Singapore.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"7","iso":"mad","year":1994,"type":"book","provider":"LAI","org_id":"","digitizer":"SABDA","archive_id":"MADLAI_DBS_HS/Madura-(1994)-Bible-(SABDA)-print","language":{"iso":"mad","glotto_id":"nucl1460","name":"Madurese","autonym":" بَهاسَ مَدورا","level":"L","location":"Indonesia, Java and Bali","area":"North coastal area of east Java, Sapudi Islands, Madura Island.
