Scrivener undertook the meticulous task of reproducing the Greek text underlying the Authorised Version (AV) of 1611 as accurately as possible. His work was a significant endeavor in biblical scholarship, as the AV was not translated from a single printed edition of the Greek text. Instead, the AV translators drew heavily upon William Tyndale's work and other English Bible editions, leading to instances where the Greek basis of the New Testament was unclear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScrivener's approach involved starting with the Beza edition of 1598 and meticulously identifying where the English text diverged from the Greek. He conducted an extensive examination of eighteen editions of the Textus Receptus to determine the correct Greek renderings and adapted his Greek text accordingly. Through this rigorous process, Scrivener succeeded in creating an edition of the Greek New Testament that more closely aligns with the text of the AV than any other single edition of the Textus Receptus. His work provided a vital tool for understanding the textual basis of the AV and contributed significantly to the field of textual criticism and biblical studies.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"26","iso":"grc","year":1881,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCSCRI_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
