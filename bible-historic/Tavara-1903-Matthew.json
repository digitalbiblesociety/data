It is spoken by 20,000 people who live in hamlets and small villages on the East Cape peninsula, on the shores of Milne Bay, and on areas of the islands of Sideia and Basilaki. There are approximately 40 main centers of the population each speaking the same dialect, although through the process of colonization some centers have gained more prominence than others. The larger group of historically related languages—called Shona languages by linguists—also includes Ndau (Eastern Shona) and Kalanga (Western Shona).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1898 Mark London MS, Auckland;  1903 Matthew BFBS, London Translated by LMS teachers from Samoa.;  1930 Mark (revised) BFBS, London Revised by R.
