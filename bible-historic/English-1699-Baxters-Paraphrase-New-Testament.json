This paraphrase of the New Testament reflects Baxter's intent to make the text more accessible and understandable to a broad audience. He aimed to provide a resource that could aid families in daily reading and help all people, regardless of their educational background, to comprehend the New Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBaxter's work, however, was not without controversy. His paraphrase included criticisms of the Church of England, which led to his imprisonment and severe punishment, though he was eventually released. The text is characterized by doctrinal and practical notes throughout, which are marked by their plainness and brevity, designed to assist readers in grasping the meaning of the New Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe edition mentioned, \"A Paraphrase on the New Testament with Notes Doctrinal and Practical,\" was printed in London in 1685 by B. Simmons and Tho. Simmons. It saw a second edition in 1695 and was reprinted again in 1810. This work not only represents an important aspect of religious literature in the 17th century but also highlights the challenges faced by religious dissenters during this period. The mention of a penned quote from Baxter's court trial in the copy of the book further adds to its historical significance, offering a glimpse into the contentious religious environment of that era.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://library.garrett.edu/collections/special-collections/rare-bible-digital-exhibit/post-1600/baxters-paraphrase-new-testament-1685","filesize":"70","iso":"eng","year":1699,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGBAX_DBS_HS/English-(1699)-Baxters-Paraphrase-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
