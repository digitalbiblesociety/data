The Furtmeyr Bible - Illuminated (WDL-8924)","title_vernacular":"Furtmeyr-Bibel (1465 ca., Illuminiert) (WDL-8924)","description":"The Furtmeyr Bible, illuminated around 1465 by Berthold Furtmeyr, a renowned painter of the Regensburg Renaissance, is an exquisite example of German Bible manuscripts from the late medieval period. Covering the Old Testament books from Genesis to Ruth, this manuscript, commissioned by Ulrich Stauff zu Ehrenfels and his wife Clara Hofer von Lobenstein, showcases the collaborative effort of Furtmeyr and his school of illuminators. Although only one volume survives today, its artistry remains unmatched, featuring three full-page miniatures, including depictions of the donators with their family, the Virgin Mary with Jesus, and a unique \"living cross.\" Additionally, the manuscript is adorned with 355 pictorial fields and 20 initials, noted for nocturnal scenes and a Renaissance-era appreciation for the female nude. After changing hands due to the turmoil of the Thirty Years War, the Furtmeyr Bible was eventually repatriated to the Bavarian State Library in 1960, where it stands as a testament to the rich artistic and cultural heritage of medieval Germany.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8916","filesize":"104","iso":"gmh","year":1465,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GMHFURT_DBS_HS/German-Middle-(1465-ca.)-The-Furtmeyr-Bible-Illuminated-(WDL-8924)","language":{"iso":"gmh","glotto_id":"midd1343","name":"Middle High German (ca. 1050-1500)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
