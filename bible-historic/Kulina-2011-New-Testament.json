{"id":"Kulina-2011-New-Testament","abbr":"CULWBT","title":"Kulina (2011) New Testament","title_vernacular":"Kulina Testamento Novo 2011","description":"Kulina (also Kulína, Kulyna, Culina, Curina, Corina, Korina, Culina-Madijá, Madijá, Madija, Madiha, Madihá) is an Arawan language of Brazil and Peru spoken by about 4,000 Kulina people. With such few speakers, Kulina is considered a threatened language. Kulina is similar to the Deni language, as they have even been considered different dialects of the same language. Both languages have SOV word order, as well as three sets of alveolar affricate consonants. It is believed the presence of the reconstructed phoneme *s in place of the fricative *s is indicative of the Kulina and Deni languages as opposed to other languages in the Arawan family.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"3","iso":"cul","year":2011,"type":"book","provider":"Liga Biblica-Wycliffe","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"","archive_id":"CULWBT_DBS_HS/Kulina-(2011)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"cul","glotto_id":"culi1244","name":"Culina","autonym":"Corina","level":"L","location":"Western Central Brazil","area":"Amazonas, Acre.
