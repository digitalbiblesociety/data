Although these islands were captured by the Dutch in 1634, they had been settled by the Spanish during the early 16th century, and the Spanish language had become well entrenched. It con- tinued to be used by the predominantly mestizo population and was gradually creolized. Papiamento is the only Spanish Creole spoken in the world today, although pidginized forms of Spanish are still used in the Philippines.
