It is closely related to neighboring Dari with which it forms a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of the Persian language. Several scholars consider Tajik as a dialectal variety of Persian rather than a language on its own. The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that, during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian, prominent intellectual Sadriddin Ayni counterargued that Tajik was not a \"bastardized dialect\" of Persian. The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages has political sides to it.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"273","iso":"abh","year":1992,"type":"genesis","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"ABHPOR_DBS_HS/Tajiki-(1992)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"abh","glotto_id":"taji1248","name":"Tajiki Arabic","level":"L","location":"Afghanistan","area":"Khatlon Province, Vakhsh Valley villages; Kuliab and Leninabad cities.
