Traditionally, its speakers live in territory that is part of the Great Sandy Desert and near the Canning Stock Route, as well as Christmas Creek and Fitzroy Crossing. These are areas that are considered deserts but have many water holes that speakers travel between. There are an estimated 1,080 speakers of Martu Wangka in various communities across the Western Desert region. The largest of these communities is estimated at 100 speakers, while some of the smallest communities have as few as 15 speakers. While older speakers continue to use Martu Wangka as their primary language, younger speakers tend to understand Martu Wangka but use different languages in their daily lives. For example, many younger speakers primarily use an English-based creole commonly referred to as the Fitzroy Valley Kriol.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"785","iso":"mpj","year":1994,"type":"genesis","provider":"The Bible Society in Australia","org_id":"bible-society-of-australia","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"MPJBSA_DBS_HS/Mamamili-Wangka-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"mpj","glotto_id":"mart1256","name":"Martu Wangka","autonym":"Wati","level":"L","location":"Australia","area":"Western Australia, Jigalong area, west side of Lake Disappointment, Great Sandy Desert.","country_id":"AU","latitude":-24.31936,"longitude":121.9536,"population":1080,"status_id":"5"}}
