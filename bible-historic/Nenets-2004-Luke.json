They are often treated as being two dialects of the same language, but they are very different and mutual intelligibility is low. The languages are Tundra Nenets, which has a higher number of speakers, spoken by some 30,000 to 40,000 people in an area stretching from the Kanin Peninsula to the Yenisei River, and Forest Nenets, spoken by 1,000 to 1,500 people in the area around the Agan, Pur, Lyamin and Nadym rivers.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"311","iso":"yrk","year":2004,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"YRKIBT_DBS_HS/Nenets-(2004)-Luke","language":{"iso":"yrk","glotto_id":"nene1249","name":"Nenets","autonym":"ненэцяʼ вадаnenécja' vada","level":"L","location":"Central Russia","country_id":"RU","latitude":66.17749,"longitude":71.02339,"population":21900,"status_id":"6b"}}
