Codex Aureus Gospels and Acts - Illuminated (WDL-17185)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCodex Aureus, produced around 750 in southern England, likely in Canterbury, is among the most lavish English medieval manuscripts extant. This manuscript is notable for its use of alternate purple and uncolored leaves, written in uncial script using black, red, white, gold, and silver inks. It features two surviving full-page portraits of the Evangelists, executed in Anglo-Saxon style with Byzantine and Italian influences. The uncial script, arranged in carmina figurata (figure poems) on specific pages, the Evangelists' miniatures, and the use of purple parchment, all mirror the grandeur of imperial manuscripts from late antiquity. The manuscript has sustained damage, with three leaves partially cut away but with no loss of text, and it originally contained at least five additional leaves. The manuscript's history is notable: an Anglo-Saxon inscription from the ninth century recounts its theft by Vikings and later restoration to Christ Church Cathedral in Canterbury. Its whereabouts remained stable until the late 17th century, when Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld, a Swedish envoy and linguist, acquired it in Madrid from the library of Gaspar de Haro. Sparwenfeld donated the Codex Aureus to the Royal Library (National Library of Sweden) in 1705, where it remains a key artifact of medieval script and art.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/17185","filesize":"224","iso":"lat","year":750,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATAURE_DBS_HS/Latin-(0750-ca.)-Codex-Aureus-Gospels-and-Acts-Illuminated-(WDL-17185)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
