Classification of Rotuman is difficult because of the large number of loan words from Samoan and Tongan, as a result of much cultural exchange over the history of the Pacific. Linguist Andrew Pawley groups the language with the West Fijian languages in a West Fijian–Rotuman branch of the Central Pacific subgroup of Oceanic languages.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"264","iso":"rtm","year":1975,"type":"genesis","provider":"United Bible Societies","org_id":"united-bible-societies","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"RTMPOR_DBS_HS/Rotuman-(1975)-Genesis-Portion-(Kamataga)","language":{"iso":"rtm","glotto_id":"rotu1241","name":"Rotuman","autonym":"Fäeag Rotuma","level":"L","location":"Fiji","area":"Rotuma Island.","country_id":"FJ","latitude":-12.50082,"longitude":177.06614,"population":2500,"status_id":"6b"}}
