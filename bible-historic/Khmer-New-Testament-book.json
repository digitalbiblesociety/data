Khmer has been influenced considerably by Sanskrit and Pali, especially in the royal and religious registers, through Hinduism and Buddhism. It is also the earliest recorded and earliest written language of the Mon–Khmer family, predating Mon and Vietnamese, due to Old Khmer being the language of the historical empires of Chenla, Angkor and, presumably, their earlier predecessor state, Funan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe vast majority of Khmer speakers speak Central Khmer, the dialect of the central plain where the Khmer are most heavily concentrated. Within Cambodia, regional accents exist in remote areas but these are regarded as varieties of Central Khmer. Two exceptions are the speech of the capital, Phnom Penh, and that of the Khmer Khe in Stung Treng province, both of which differ sufficiently enough from Central Khmer to be considered separate dialects of Khmer.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"2","iso":"khm","year":2005,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"KHMKSV_DBS_HS/Khmer-New-Testament-(book)","language":{"iso":"khm","glotto_id":"cent1989","iso1":"km","name":"Khmer","autonym":"Cambodian","level":"L","location":"Cambodia","area":"Widespread.
