{"id":"Hebrew-0900-Damascus-Codex-HighRes-Manuscript","abbr":"HBODAMA","title":"Hebrew (0900) Damascus Codex (Pentateuch) Manuscript","title_vernacular":"עברית - כתב יד דמשק (0900, חמשה חומשי תורה)","description":"The Damascus Pentateuch, also known as Keter Dameseq or Crown of Damascus, is an important 10th-century Hebrew Bible codex. This manuscript primarily consists of the almost complete Pentateuch, which includes the Five Books of Moses. One of the notable aspects of the Damascus Pentateuch is that it was copied by an unknown scribe and is replete with Masoretic annotations, which are critical for understanding the textual transmission of the Hebrew Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the manuscript is not complete; it is defective at the beginning, starting from Genesis 9:26, and also missing the section from Exodus 18:1–23. Despite these omissions, the Damascus Pentateuch is a valuable resource for biblical scholars and historians.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1975, the manuscript was acquired by the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem, an institution that later changed its name to the National Library of Israel in 2008. The significance of the Damascus Pentateuch was recognized with its publication in a large, two-volume facsimile edition in 1978, making it accessible for scholarly study.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is important to note that the Damascus Pentateuch should not be confused with another manuscript known as the Damascus Crown (Damascus Keter) of medieval Spanish origin, which contains 24 canonical books. The Damascus Pentateuch, with its rich annotations and historical value, remains an important artifact in the study of the Hebrew Bible and the Masoretic tradition.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13016","filesize":"406","iso":"hbo","year":900,"type":"manuscript","provider":"David Solomon Sassoon","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"HBODAMA_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(0900)-Damascus-Codex-(HighRes)-Manuscript","language":{"iso":"hbo","glotto_id":"anci1244","name":"Ancient Hebrew","autonym":"עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית","level":"H","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.77607,"longitude":35.17248,"status_id":"9"}}
