{"id":"Digor-2002-John","abbr":"OSSIBTD","title":"Digor (2002) John","title_vernacular":"Digor (2002) Йоанн","description":"Digor or Digorian (дигорон digoron) is a dialect of the Ossetian language spoken by the Digor people. It is less widely spoken than Iron, the other extant Ossetian dialect. The two are distinct enough to sometimes be considered separate languages; in the recently published Digor–Russian dictionary, the compiler Fedar Takazov refers to a \"Digor language\", though the editor in the same book uses \"Digor dialect\". Until 1939, Digor had a literary language separate from Iron.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"11","iso":"oss","year":2002,"type":"book","provider":"The British and Foreign Bible Society","org_id":"british-and-foreign-bible-society","digitizer":"","archive_id":"OSSIBTD_DBS_HS/Digor-(2002)-John","language":{"iso":"oss","glotto_id":"osse1245","iso1":"os","name":"Ossetian","autonym":"ирон ӕвзаг","level":"L","location":"Western Russia","area":"Also in Azerbaijan, Germany, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation (Asia), Tajikistan, Turkey (Asia), Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"RU","latitude":41.78816,"longitude":43.26738,"population":601450,"status_id":"5"}}
