Gospel of Passau - Illuminated (WDL-13477)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWritten and illuminated in the 12th century in Passau, Bavaria, this Gospel lectionary contains the liturgical Gospel readings for major feast days. The manuscript was used at least until the 15th century, evident in the exquisite metal binding with deep relief featuring a rock crystal carved figure of Christ added during that period. The manuscript is a prime example of Romanesque illumination from southeast Bavaria, showcasing magnificent gold initials with near-naturalistic animal representations and climbing figures in the tendrils. Five full-page miniatures with figurative illuminations correspond to specific feast days, such as John the Baptist, the birth of the Virgin, and Peter and Paul's feast. The picture cycle culminates with Ecclesia (the church) on her throne, holding a cross and an oil lamp. The illuminations were executed by two artists: the \"Master of Saint Peter,\" named after his work on folio 32 verso (the crucifixion of Saint Peter), and the \"Master of Ecclesia,\" who painted the Ecclesia miniature on folio 39 verso. This Gospel lectionary is a significant piece of religious and artistic heritage, exemplifying the skill and creativity of medieval illumination.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13477","filesize":"24","iso":"lat","year":1170,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATPASS_DBS_HS/Latin-(1170-ca.)-Gospel-of-Passau-Illuminated-(WDL-13477)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
