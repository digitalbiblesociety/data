They were a settled and generally peaceful tribe, but their allegiance to the French, and later the British, led them into war against the colonists in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Most of the tribe were finally settled on a reservation in Nebraska and on public domain allotments in Wisconsin. There are now about 3,000 there. Winnebago is a Siouan language, related closely to the Chiwere dialects of the Iowa, Oto, and Missouri tribes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1907 Gospels Acts Genesis ABS, NewYork Translated by John Stacy, a Winnebago of Wisconsin, and Jacob Stucki, a Reformed Church missionary.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"78","iso":"win","year":1907,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"WINS07_DBS_HS/Winnebago-(1907)-Gospels-and-OT-Portions","language":{"iso":"win","glotto_id":"hoch1243","name":"Ho-Chunk","autonym":"Ho-Chunk","level":"L","location":"Northern Central United States of America","area":"Central Wisconsin scattered; eastern Nebraska, Winnebago Reservation.","country_id":"US","latitude":43.5,"longitude":-88.5,"population":250,"status_id":"8a"}}
