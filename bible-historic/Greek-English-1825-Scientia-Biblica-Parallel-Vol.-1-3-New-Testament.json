Booth in London. This work is notable for its presentation of the New Testament in the original Greek alongside the English Vulgate. A distinguishing feature of this edition is its extensive and original collection of parallel passages, which are printed in full words, offering a comprehensive resource for comparative study and analysis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis edition was revised by Dr. Blayney, under the direction of the Lord Chancellor and delegates of the Clarendon Press. A significant aspect of this revision was the meticulous examination and correction of the marginal references. Furthermore, an impressive number of new references, totaling thirty-thousand-four hundred, were added to the margins. This enhancement significantly broadens the scope of study and cross-referencing capabilities within the text.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Scientia Biblica\" stands out for its scholarly rigor and the depth of its cross-referential material. The parallel format, combined with the corrected and expanded marginal references, makes it a valuable tool for scholars, theologians, and students engaged in in-depth biblical studies, particularly those interested in the textual comparison and analysis of the New Testament.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"121","iso":"grc","year":1825,"type":"study","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCTRE_DBS_HS/Greek-English-(1825)-Scientia-Biblica-Parallel-(Vol.-1-3)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
