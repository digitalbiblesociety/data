This manuscript, written in Latin on vellum, is bound in a 19th-century cover. Psalters, popular in the Middle Ages, are religious books containing Biblical psalms and other devotional texts. The Psalter is lavishly decorated, featuring a fully illuminated page with the Tree of Jesse and a miniature of King David, traditionally credited as the primary author of the psalms. It includes twelve illuminations, each with two panels, illustrating the months of the year and the zodiac signs. Additionally, nine sheets are adorned with ornate borders of flowers, birds, and butterflies. The final illumination marks the beginning of the Office of the Dead. The manuscript was commissioned by an unidentified ecclesiastic, evidenced by a coat of arms painted nine times within the volume, depicting a blue lion rampant on a silver background. This Psalter is a significant example of the rich tradition of manuscript illumination in the late Middle Ages, particularly in the Flemish region.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/232","filesize":"78","iso":"lat","year":1500,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATFLEM_DBS_HS/Latin-(1500)-Flemish-Psalter-Illuminated-(WDL-232)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
