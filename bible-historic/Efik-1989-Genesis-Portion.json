{"id":"Efik-1989-Genesis-Portion","abbr":"EFIGEN","title":"Efik (1989) Genesis Portion","title_vernacular":"Efik (1989) Idim Ete","description":"Efik is the indigenous language of the Efik people, who are situated in the present-day Cross River state and Akwa Ibom state of Nigeria, as well as in the North-West of Cameroon. The Efik language is mutually intelligible with other lower Cross River languages such as Ibibio, Annang, Oro, and Ekid but the degree of intelligibility in the case of Oro and Ekid is unidirectional; in other words, speakers of these languages speak and understand Efik (and Ibibio) but not vice versa. The Efik vocabulary has been enriched and influenced by external contact with the British, Portuguese, and other surrounding communities such as Balondo, Oron, Efut, Okoyong, Efiat and Ekoi (Qua).","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"277","iso":"efi","year":1989,"type":"genesis","provider":"The British and Foreign Bible Society","org_id":"british-and-foreign-bible-society","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"EFIGEN_DBS_HS/Efik-(1989)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"efi","glotto_id":"efik1245","name":"Efik","autonym":"Ik…î Efik","level":"L","location":"Nigeria, Map 10","area":"Cross River state, Calabar Municipality, Odukpani and Akamkpa LGAs; Akwa Ibom state, Itu town.
