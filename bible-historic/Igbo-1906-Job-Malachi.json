The core Igbo cluster or Igbo proper is generally thought to be one language but there is limited mutual intelligibility between the different groupings (north, west, south and east). A standard literary language termed 'Igbo izugbe' (meaning \"general igbo\") was generically developed and later adopted around 1972, with its core foundation based on the Owerri (Isuama), Anambra (Awka) and Umuahia (Ohuhu) dialects, omitting the nasalization and aspiration of those varieties. However, nobody speaks \"general Igbo\" natively and it isn't accepted by all Igbo groups. The largest variety of the core Igbo cluster is Ngwa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1893 Gospels 1 896 Psalms Acts—Colossians BFBS, London: Translated by H. Johnson and H. H.
