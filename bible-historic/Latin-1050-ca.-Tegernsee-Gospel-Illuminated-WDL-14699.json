Tegernsee Gospel - Illuminated (WDL-14699)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDating from the second half of the 11th century, this richly decorated Gospel book features portraits of the Evangelists Matthew, Mark, and Luke (with John's portrait missing), four decorated initial pages, and 84 primarily ornamental initials. Nine canon tables, adorned with arcades and tympana and based on the work of Eusebius of Caesarea (circa 260−339), precede the Gospel texts. These concordance tables, commonly found in Gospel books, are a distinctive feature of the manuscript.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe manuscript's origin is debated among scholars, but it is widely believed to have been intended for Freising and crafted in the scriptorium of the Tegernsee Abbey in southern Bavaria. Following the dissolution of the monastery in 1803, the Gospel book was transferred to Munich. This manuscript stands as a significant artifact, showcasing the artistic and religious sensibilities of the medieval period, particularly within the Bavarian region.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/14699","filesize":"79","iso":"lat","year":1050,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATTEGE_DBS_HS/Latin-(1050-ca.)-Tegernsee-Gospel-Illuminated-(WDL-14699)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
