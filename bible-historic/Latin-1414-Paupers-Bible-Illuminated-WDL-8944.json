To fulfill his ambitious manuscript project, the abbot hired skilled artists familiar with Bohemian illumination traditions. This manuscript from southern Germany is distinguished by its colored line drawings, where text and illustrations merge seamlessly. Key texts include Rabanus Maurus's \"De laudibus sanctae crucis\" (In honor of the Holy Cross), the Biblia pauperum itself, notable for its unique pictorial style, and Pope Innocent III's \"De sacro altaris mysterio\" (Concerning the sacred mystery of the altar), featuring 43 allegorical figures and circular schemata. The Gospels at the beginning of the manuscript, combined with the exquisite binding incorporating saints' relics, constitute a plenary reliquary. This manuscript is held by the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany, and represents a significant compilation of religious knowledge from its era.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8944","filesize":"472","iso":"lat","year":1414,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATPAUP_DBS_HS/Latin-(1414)-Paupers-Bible-Illuminated-(WDL-8944)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
