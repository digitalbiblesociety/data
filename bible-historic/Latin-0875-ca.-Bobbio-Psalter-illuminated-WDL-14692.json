Bobbio Psalter - Illuminated (WDL-14692)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bobbio Psalter, circa 875, is one of three manuscripts preserving the diacritical Milan recension of the Psalms, a revision undertaken between the late 8th and mid-9th centuries. The core Psalms are prefaced by a critical introduction on the text and other preliminary materials, followed by biblical canticles and hymns arranged in a typical Milanese style. Recent studies suggest this copy originated in the last decades of the 9th century in Milan, where it remained for about three centuries. Its journey to the Munich ducal art collection, where it was documented by 1580, remains unclear; it was later transferred to the court library.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe manuscript features a full-page image of David as the Psalmist, adorned with interlace frames, historiated, and figured initials. The predominant stylistic influence is Franco-Saxon illumination, with regional variations and elements from late antiquity, especially in the figural representations. This manuscript is a significant example of the fusion of various artistic traditions in medieval manuscript illumination, reflecting the cultural and religious milieu of the period.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/14692","filesize":"78","iso":"lat","year":875,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Ex Electorali Biblio Theca SerenissVtrivsq","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATBOBB_DBS_HS/Latin-(0875-ca.)-Bobbio-Psalter-illuminated-(WDL-14692)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
