It is one of the two Delaware languages, the other being Munsee. The last fluent speaker in the United States, Edward Thompson, of the Delaware Tribe of Indians, died on August 31, 2002. His sister Nora Thompson Dean (1907â€“1984) provided valuable information about the language to linguists and other scholars.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Lenni-Lenape,\" literally means \"Men of Men\", but is translated to mean \"Original People.\" The Lenape names for the areas they inhabited were Scheyichbi (i.e. New Jersey), which means \"water's edge\", and Lenapehoking, meaning \"in the land of the Delaware Indians.\" It describes the ancient homeland of all Delaware Indians, both Unami, and Munsee.
