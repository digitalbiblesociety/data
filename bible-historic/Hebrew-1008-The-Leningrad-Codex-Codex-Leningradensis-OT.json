According to its colophon, the codex was created in Cairo in 1008 CE, or possibly 1009. This manuscript is central to the study and understanding of the Hebrew scriptures.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is a theory suggesting that the Leningrad Codex may have been corrected against the Aleppo Codex, a slightly earlier manuscript that was partially lost in the mid-20th century. However, Paul E. Kahle posited that the Leningrad manuscript likely relied on other, now-lost manuscripts from the ben Asher family. Despite the Aleppo Codex being several decades older, it has been missing significant parts since the anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo in 1947. Consequently, the Leningrad Codex is the oldest complete codex of the Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn modern biblical scholarship, the Leningrad Codex is of immense importance. It is the Hebrew text reproduced in major editions of the Hebrew Bible, including Biblia Hebraica (1937), Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (1977), and Biblia Hebraica Quinta (2004–present). Additionally, it serves as a crucial source for reconstructing the missing parts of the Aleppo Codex, thereby aiding in the preservation and understanding of the ancient textual tradition of the Hebrew Bible.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"182","iso":"hbo","year":1008,"type":"manuscript","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HBOLENI_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1008)-The-Leningrad-Codex-(Codex-Leningradensis)-OT","language":{"iso":"hbo","glotto_id":"anci1244","name":"Ancient Hebrew","autonym":"עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית","level":"H","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.77607,"longitude":35.17248,"status_id":"9"}}
