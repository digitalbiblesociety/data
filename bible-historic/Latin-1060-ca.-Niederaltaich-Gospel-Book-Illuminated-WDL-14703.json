Niederaltaich Gospel Book - Illuminated (WDL-14703)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis mid-11th century Gospel book includes 16 canon tables after the prologues, nine full-page carpet pages, initial pages, decorated pages, and four portraits of the Evangelists, each painted on single pages. The Evangelists are represented with their symbols: the angel for Matthew, the lion for Mark, the ox for Luke, and the eagle for John, alongside the dove of the Holy Spirit symbolizing divine inspiration. Specific liturgical feast days mentioned in the text suggest its origin in North Germany. An inscription on folio 3 verso reveals that by the late Middle Ages, the manuscript belonged to the Niederaltaich abbey in southern Bavaria, where it underwent cover restoration in 1601. Following the monastery's dissolution, the book was transferred to Munich in 1803. This Gospel book is a significant artifact of religious art, reflecting the rich liturgical and artistic traditions of its time.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/14703","filesize":"86","iso":"lat","year":1060,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATNGB_DBS_HS/Latin-(1060-ca.)-Niederaltaich-Gospel-Book-Illuminated-(WDL-14703)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
