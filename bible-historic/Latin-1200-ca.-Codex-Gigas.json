Codex Gigas\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Codex Gigas, also known as the \"Giant Book\" or \"Devil's Bible,\" is the largest medieval illuminated manuscript in the world, measuring 92 cm (36 in) in length. Created in the early 13th century at the Benedictine monastery of Podlažice in Bohemia, now the Czech Republic, it contains the complete Vulgate Bible along with other works, all in Latin. Between the Old and New Testaments are various medieval reference works, including Josephus's \"Antiquities of the Jews\" and \"De bello iudaico,\" Isidore of Seville's \"Etymologiae,\" Cosmas of Prague's chronicle, and medical treatises.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter being housed in the imperial library of Rudolf II in Prague, the Codex Gigas was taken by the Swedish as war spoils in 1648 during the Thirty Years' War and is now in the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm. The binding is wooden, covered in leather with metal guards and fittings. Weighing 74.8 kg (165 lb), the Codex Gigas is believed to be made from 160 donkey skins or calfskin. It includes illuminations in red, blue, yellow, green, and gold, with 57 elaborately illuminated capital letters and 20 initials in blue with red vine decorations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe manuscript features two images representing Heaven and Earth and a notorious full-page portrait of Satan. The codex's extraordinary size and detail have led to legends about its creation, including the story of it being written in a single night with the devil's assistance. Initially containing 320 sheets, twelve were later removed for unknown reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first page includes two Hebrew alphabets, and there are slips with Early Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets. About half of the codex consists of the entire Latin Bible in the Vulgate version. Other contents include the works of Josephus, Isidore's Etymologiae, and medical works. The New Testament is followed by prayers, conjurations, and charms. A National Geographic documentary suggests, based on handwriting analysis and a credit to Hermann Inclusus, that the manuscript was the work of a single scribe, with an estimated twenty years needed to reproduce the calligraphy alone.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"486","iso":"lat","year":1200,"type":"illuminated","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LATGIGA_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
