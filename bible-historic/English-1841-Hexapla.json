{"id":"English-1841-Hexapla","abbr":"ENGKJV","title":"English (1841) Hexapla","title_vernacular":"","description":"English (1841) Hexapla: The English Hexapla, published in 1841, is a remarkable work that presents six of the most significant English translations of the New Testament side by side. These translations are those of Wycliffe (1380), Tyndale (1534), Cranmer (1539), the Geneva Bible (1557), the Anglo-Rhemish (1582), and the Authorized King James Version (1611). Alongside these English translations, the original Greek text as edited by Scholz is included. The Hexapla also provides various readings from the Textus Receptus and key Constantinopolitan and Alexandrine manuscripts, as well as a thorough comparison of Scholz's Greek text with Griesbach's 1805 edition. The publication is notable for its comprehensive collation and its historical account of English translations of the Bible. It represents a significant scholarly resource for understanding the development of biblical translation into English and the textual variations across different translations.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"170","iso":"eng","year":1841,"type":"study","provider":"GreatSite.com","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGHEX_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
