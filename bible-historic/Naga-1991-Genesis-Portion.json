Spoken natively by an estimated 30,000 people in the Indian northeastern state of Nagaland, it developed primarily as a means of marketplace and trade communication. Despite the official language of the state being English, Nagamese functions as a lingua franca that is spoken by nearly the entirety of Nagaland inhabitants. It is also used in mass media as well as in official, state-regulated domains, including news and radio stations, education, and political and governmental spheres. Nagamese is classified as a creole as, despite it being spoken as an \"extended pidgin\" by the majority of speakers across Nagaland, it is also spoken as the native mother tongue of the Dimasa community in Nagaland's largest city, Dimapur.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"277","iso":"nag","year":1991,"type":"genesis","provider":"The Bible Society of India","org_id":"bible-society-of-india","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"NAGNBP_DBS_HS/Naga-(1991)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"nag","glotto_id":"naga1394","name":"Naga Pidgin","autonym":"Naga Pidgin","level":"L","location":"India, Map 5","area":"Nagaland, Kohima District, Dimapur Subdivision; Arunachal Pradesh border area.","country_id":"IN","latitude":25.25077,"longitude":93.44376,"population":30000,"status_id":"3"}}
