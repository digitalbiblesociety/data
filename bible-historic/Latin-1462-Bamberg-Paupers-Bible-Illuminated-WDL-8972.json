Central events from Christ's life are presented alongside corresponding Old Testament scenes, flanked by four prophets, symbolizing the New Testament's fulfillment of the Old. Designed with striking imagery, this work likely served as a teaching tool for laymen or lower clergy who couldn't afford a full Bible. This edition, the first Biblia pauperum to merge woodcuts with movable type text, was produced in Bamberg in Albrecht Pfister’s workshop. Pfister (circa 1420–circa 1470) was among the first printers to use woodcuts in book illustrations. Integrating images into printed text was challenging initially, but Pfister's edition simplified this by combining text and illustration in a single printing form, enhancing the efficiency of the printing process. Consequently, woodcuts started to replace hand-copied pen drawings in books intended for religious instruction or practical use. The Bamberg Paupers Bible thus marks a significant advancement in the history of book printing and illustration.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8972","filesize":"9","iso":"lat","year":1462,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Bamberg, Germany","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATBAMB_DBS_HS/Latin-(1462)-Bamberg-Paupers-Bible-Illuminated-(WDL-8972)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
