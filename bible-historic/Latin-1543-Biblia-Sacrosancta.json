Juda's death in 1542 left the work incomplete, which was then taken over by Theodor Bibliander. Bibliander translated several key sections: Ezekiel chapters 41 to 48, Daniel, Job, Psalms 103 to 150, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Solomon. The Zurich version of the Apocrypha included in this Bible was translated by Pierre Cholin. Meanwhile, the New Testament component was a revision of Erasmus' version, undertaken by Rudolf Gualter. This compilation of three distinct versions, encompassing the Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament, was edited and assembled by Conrad Pellican, as noted by Darlow \u0026 Moule. The Biblia Sacrosancta represents a collaborative effort that contributed significantly to biblical scholarship and translation during the Reformation period, reflecting the linguistic and theological endeavors of its contributors.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"197","iso":"lat","year":1543,"type":"scan","provider":"Tigvrl Bxcvdebat Christ","org_id":"","digitizer":"Google","archive_id":"LATBSV_DBS_HS/Latin-(1543)-Biblia-Sacrosancta","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
