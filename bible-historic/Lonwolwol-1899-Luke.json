Ambrim Island is east of Malekula, in the central New Hebrides. The Fanting language was once the dominant tongue of the island, but in 1913 a volcanic eruption caused the Lonwolwol tribe to disperse, and their language came into use as the lingua franca of the island.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1899 Luke BFBS, Dunedin Translated by R.
