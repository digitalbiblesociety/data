This version, originating from the 5th century, holds significant importance as it is derived from an Aramaic dialect closely related to that spoken by Jesus and his Apostles. Murdock, a respected scholar with a Doctorate in Sacred Theology (S.T.D.), took the unique approach of using Aramaic as his primary source text instead of the more commonly used Koine Greek.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis approach is particularly valuable for biblical scholars and enthusiasts as it offers a glimpse into the linguistic environment of the time of Jesus. Murdock's translation highlights the subtleties, idioms, and cultural nuances inherent in the original language, many of which can be lost or misinterpreted when translated from Greek. His work provides a deeper and arguably more authentic insight into the New Testament, making it a vital resource for understanding the context and meaning behind the teachings and events described in the Christian scriptures.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"63","iso":"eng","year":1851,"type":"scan","provider":"Stanford and Swords","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGMUR_DBS_HS/English-(1851)-Murdoch-New-Testament-(Syriac-Peshito)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
