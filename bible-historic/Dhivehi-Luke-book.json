The Maldivian language has notable dialects. The standard dialect is that of the capital city, Malé. The greatest dialectal variation is from the southern atolls Huvadu, Addu and Fuvahmulah of Maldives. Each of those atolls has its own dialect closely related to each other but very different from the northern atolls. The southern atoll dialects are so distinct that those only speaking northern dialects cannot understand them.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"530","iso":"div","year":2004,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"DIVWBT_DBS_HS/Dhivehi-Luke-(book)","language":{"iso":"div","glotto_id":"dhiv1236","iso1":"dv","name":"Dhivehi","autonym":"Maldivian","level":"L","location":"India, Map 9","area":"Widespread.
