Reichenau Gospels - Illuminated (WDL-13013)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis mid-11th century Gospel Book is attributed to the Abbey of Reichenau on Lake Constance in Germany, identified by its script and illumination. The manuscript's decoration aligns with the Luithar school of Reichenau, with ornamental motifs closely resembling those in Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Clm. 4453, and a palette nearly identical to Reichenau manuscripts in the Bamberg Cathedral Treasury. The book includes full-page miniatures of Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to the four Evangelists. Gold uncials at the start of each paragraph and chapter are characteristic of Reichenau craftsmanship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe text, written in Caroline minuscule, has paleographic links to Bamberg, Staatsbibliothek, Mss. Bibl. 76 and Bibl. 22, as well as Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm. 4454. As a whole, this Gospel Book exemplifies Ottonian book illumination's excellence. The Ottonian period, named after German kings and Holy Roman Emperors Otto I, II, and III of the Saxon dynasty, was a time of significant artistic development during the 10th and early 11th centuries, as evidenced in this manuscript.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13013","filesize":"76","iso":"lat","year":1050,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Henry Walters","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATREIC_DBS_HS/Latin-(1050-ca.)-Reichenau-Gospels-Illuminated-(WDL-13013)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
