It lies to the west of New Georgia but is considered one of the New Georgia Group. To its west are the Treasury Islands. The Bilua language spoken on the island belongs to the Papuan languages, while the other languages of the Solomon Islands belong to the Austronesian languages. Therefore, archaeologists suspect the immigration of people who did not come from the Melanesian settlement area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1919 Mark BFBS, Melbourne Translated by R. C.
