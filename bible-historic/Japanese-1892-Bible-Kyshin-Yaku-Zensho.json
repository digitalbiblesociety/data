Japan, with its rich and unique cultural heritage, has a complex linguistic background with no widely accepted affiliations to other language families. Christianity's introduction to Japan dates back to 1549 with Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier. Initial translations of parts of the New Testament into Japanese were carried out in the 16th century, though suppression of Christianity halted further efforts for centuries. It wasn't until the 19th century, with the arrival of Protestant missionaries, that Bible translation efforts resumed, culminating in publications like the 1892 Bible. This version stands as a testament to the enduring efforts to provide the Scriptures to the Japanese people, reflecting the intricate interplay of language, culture, and religion in Japan.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"104","iso":"jpn","year":1892,"type":"scan","provider":"Bible Societies Committee for Japan","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"JPNKYZ_DBS_HS/Japanese-(1892)-Bible-Kyshin-Yaku-Zensho","language":{"iso":"jpn","glotto_id":"nucl1643","iso1":"ja","name":"Japanese","autonym":"日本語","level":"L","location":"Japan","area":"Widespread.
