It is not closely related to other languages and appears to form its own branch of the Niger-Congo family, although it was formerly classified as an Atlantic language. Dialects include Tonko, Sela, Kamuke (or Ke), Wara-Wara, Keleng, Biriwa, and Safroko. The eastern variety, spoken primarily in Guinea, is quite distinct. Limba has a system of noun classes, marked by an old, eroded set of prefixes augmented by a newer set of enclitics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1911 Luke BFBS, London: Translated by Mary L.
