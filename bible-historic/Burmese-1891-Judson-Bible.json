Judson, remembered as a pioneering American missionary, dedicated his life to translating the Scriptures into Burmese, thus making the Christian faith accessible to the Burmese people for the first time. His translation efforts and establishment of Baptist churches laid the groundwork for Christian communities in Burma, now Myanmar. The language of this Bible, Burmese, belongs to the Sino-Tibetan language family and serves as the official language of Myanmar, spoken by the majority ethnic group, the Burmans. Judson's work not only contributed to the religious and cultural landscape of Myanmar but also underscored the global missionary movement's impact on language and scripture translation.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"166","iso":"mya","year":1891,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MYABJB_DBS_HS/Burmese-(1891)-Judson-Bible","language":{"iso":"mya","glotto_id":"nucl1310","iso1":"my","name":"Burmese","autonym":"Myanmar","level":"L","location":"Central Myanmar","area":"South, central, and adjacent areas.
