This part spans from the Book of Paralipomenon (Chronicles) to Malachi and incorporates prologues to various biblical texts, including the major and minor prophets, and the Gospels. Significantly, it features two prologues by Rabanus Maurus, a notable Frankish monk, to the Maccabees books, highlighting the scholarly contributions to biblical exegesis of the time. Like the first volume, this manuscript is richly adorned with 52 miniatures and floral designs indicative of a style similar to Berthold Furtmeyr's, albeit slightly earlier, marking an important phase in the evolution of German manuscript illumination. This volume, alongside its counterpart, represents a critical artifact in the study of medieval German biblical translations, manuscript art, and the religious life of 15th-century Southern Germany.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8916","filesize":"541","iso":"gmh","year":1463,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GMHRORE_DBS_HS/German-Middle-(1463)-Rorer-Old-Testament-Illuminated-Vol.-2-of-2-(WDL-8916)","language":{"iso":"gmh","glotto_id":"midd1343","name":"Middle High German (ca. 1050-1500)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
