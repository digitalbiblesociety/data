Ratisbon Dominican Bible (WDL-8956)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second volume of a Bible, once owned by the Dominican Order in Ratisbon (Regensburg), this manuscript includes the books of the prophets and other biblical texts. It is adorned with extraordinary miniatures by the renowned German Renaissance painter Berthold Furtmeyr (active 1460–1501), a key figure in the ancient Ratisbon School of Illumination. Furtmeyr, celebrated for his work on several significant projects including this manuscript, the Furtmeyr Bible, and the Salzburg feast missal in five volumes (all housed at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany), was skilled in integrating pictures, ornament, and text. His artistry is marked by vibrant colors, luminous illuminations, and meticulous craftsmanship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurtmeyr's style, while rooted in the Middle Ages, exhibits a transition to the Renaissance through his use of color, nocturnal scenes, and depictions of female nudes. This manuscript is a testament to Furtmeyr's influence in the development of manuscript illumination and the bridging of medieval and Renaissance art styles.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8956","filesize":"276","iso":"lat","year":1450,"type":"scan","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATRATI_DBS_HS/Latin-(1450-ca.)-Ratisbon-Dominican-Bible-(WDL-8956)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
