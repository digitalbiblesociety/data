{"id":"Swedish-1864-Bible-Biblia-eller-Den-Heliga-Skrift","abbr":"SWEBDHS","title":"Swedish (1864) Bible","title_vernacular":"Svenska (1864) Bibeln","description":"The Swedish Bible has a rich history of translation and revision, reflecting the country's religious evolution and the changing dynamics of its language and culture. Christianity's establishment in Sweden during the 9th century through the missionary work of Saint Ansgar laid the groundwork for the later translation of the Bible into Swedish. The first complete translation was initiated under King Gustavus Vasa in 1525, leading to the publication of the Gustavus Vasa Bible in the mid-16th century, translated by Laurentius Petri and supported by royal patronage. This version, with revisions, remains a significant part of Swedish religious life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubsequent revisions and translations, such as the 'Gustavus Adolphus Bible' of 1617-1618 and 'Charles XII’s Bible' of 1702-1703, underscore the ongoing effort to refine and adapt the Bible's text to contemporary language and understanding. The 19th and early 20th centuries saw further efforts to update the translation, culminating in the 1917 Bible by the Royal Commission, which has served as the standard Swedish Bible. Modern translations, including those based on J. N. Darby’s Greek text and the work of David Hedegård, illustrate the continued vitality of biblical scholarship in Sweden, aiming to make the Scriptures accessible and relevant to contemporary readers.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"65","iso":"swe","year":1864,"type":"scan","provider":"The British and Foreign Bible Society","org_id":"british-and-foreign-bible-society","digitizer":"Google","archive_id":"SWEBDHS_DBS_HS/Swedish-(1864)-Bible-(Biblia-eller-Den-Heliga-Skrift)","language":{"iso":"swe","glotto_id":"swed1254","iso1":"sv","name":"Swedish","autonym":"svenska","level":"L","location":"Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden","area":"The Göta dialect group south, including parts of Småland, south Swedish provinces, Värmland, Västergvtland; Svea in north, including Hälsingland, parts of Östergötland and Uppland, and Swedish-speaking parts of Finland; Southern Swedish in Skåne, Blekinge, southern Småland, southern Halland; Northern Swedish in northern Hälsingland and Jämtland and north; Jamtska mainly in Jämtland; Eastern Swedish in Finland, Estonia, and Gammalsvenskby, Ukraine; Gutnic southeast Isle of Gotland and Fårö.
