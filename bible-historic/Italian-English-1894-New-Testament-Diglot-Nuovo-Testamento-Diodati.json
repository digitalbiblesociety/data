Early translations, such as those by Niccolo Malermi and Giovanni Diodati, played pivotal roles in making the Scriptures accessible to the Italian-speaking populace. Diodati's translation, in particular, emerged as a significant Protestant Bible, notable for its scholarly rigor and literary quality that resonated with the Tuscan tradition of Dante and Petrarch. Despite ecclesiastical prohibitions, Diodati's work achieved widespread success, paralleling the impact of Luther's translation in Germany. The Martini Bible became the standard among Italian Roman Catholics, with both Diodati's and Martini's versions being central to Italian biblical literature for centuries. The 20th century saw new translations into contemporary Italian, responding to modern linguistic and cultural sensibilities, yet the historical depth and diversity of Italian Bible translations underscore the dynamic interplay of language, faith, and culture in Italy's religious landscape.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"45","iso":"ita","year":1894,"type":"scan","provider":"American Bible Society","org_id":"american-bible-society","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ITAD85_DBS_HS/Italian-English-(1894)-New-Testament-Diglot-(Nuovo-Testamento-Diodati)","language":{"iso":"ita","glotto_id":"ital1282","iso1":"it","name":"Italian","autonym":"italiano","level":"L","location":"Liechtenstein and Switzerland","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Egypt, Eritrea, France, Germany, Israel, Libya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Paraguay, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Romania, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vatican State.","country_id":"IT","latitude":43.046411,"longitude":12.648925,"population":55000000,"status_id":"1"}}
