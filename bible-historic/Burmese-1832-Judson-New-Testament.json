Adoniram Judson, an American missionary, is renowned for his pioneering efforts in translating the Bible into Burmese, a Sino-Tibetan language spoken by the country's principal ethnic group, the Burmans. His work extended beyond translation to the establishment of several Baptist churches across Burma, marking the beginning of significant missionary activity in the region by an American. Judson's translation played a crucial role in spreading Christianity within Myanmar, making the Christian scriptures accessible to the Burmese-speaking population for the first time. His contributions are remembered for laying the foundations of the Baptist denomination in Myanmar and for his role as a trailblazer in American overseas missionary work.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"111","iso":"mya","year":1832,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MYABJB_DBS_HS/Burmese-(1832)-Judson-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"mya","glotto_id":"nucl1310","iso1":"my","name":"Burmese","autonym":"Myanmar","level":"L","location":"Central Myanmar","area":"South, central, and adjacent areas.
