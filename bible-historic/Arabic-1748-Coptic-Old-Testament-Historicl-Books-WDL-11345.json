{"id":"Arabic-1748-Coptic-Old-Testament-Historicl-Books-WDL-11345","abbr":"ARAWMG","title":"Arabic (1748) Coptic Old Testament Historicl Books (WDL-11345)","title_vernacular":"اسفار من العهد القديم","description":"The WDL-11345 manuscript, dated 1748 and 1749, is a significant Arabic translation of portions of the Old Testament historical books – Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. This Biblical manuscript, incomplete at both the beginning and end, offers insight into the scriptural traditions of Coptic Christians in the 18th century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe scribe’s identity is unknown due to the absence of a colophon, where such information is typically recorded. The manuscript, lacking page numbers and showing inconsistent chapter marking, is characterized by careful handwriting, indicative of diligent work. Notably, there are minimal signs of extensive use, such as the absence of fore-edge smudging often found in frequently handled manuscripts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe volume’s binding is elaborate, featuring traditional fore-edge and envelope flaps typical of the region and era. The front and back leather covers are adorned with blind-stamped medallions, pendants, and corners with gilding, although the gilding has suffered significant damage over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArabic translations of the Bible used by Copts in the 18th and 19th centuries were derived from various sources, including early Coptic, Syriac, Greek, and Latin texts. The specific sources of the Arabic translations in this manuscript are not indicated, mirroring a broader historical trend. This absence of source indication is of considerable interest to scholars, particularly in the context of examining Biblical texts used by Egyptian Christians prior to Egypt’s increased interaction with Europe. As part of the Iryan Moftah Collection of Coptic Books and Manuscripts at the American University in Cairo, this manuscript represents a valuable piece in understanding the complex linguistic and religious influences in Coptic scriptural tradition.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11345","filesize":"69","iso":"arb","year":1748,"type":"scan","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"ARAWMG_DBS_HS/Arabic-(1748)-Coptic-Old-Testament-Historicl-Books-(WDL-11345)","language":{"iso":"arb","glotto_id":"stan1318","name":"Arabic","autonym":"عربي فصيح","level":"L","area":"Middle East, North Africa.
