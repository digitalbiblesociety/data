{"id":"Latin-2009-Vulgate-Bible","abbr":"LATVSB","title":"Latin (2009) Vulgate Bible","title_vernacular":"Biblia Vulgata (2009)","description":"The Vulgate was to become the Catholic Church's officially promulgated Latin version of the Bible as the Sixtine Vulgate (1590), then as the Clementine Vulgate (1592), and then as the Nova Vulgata (1979). The Vulgate is still currently used in the Latin Church. The Catholic Church affirmed the Vulgate as its official Latin Bible at the Council of Trent (1545–1563), though there was no authoritative edition at that time. The Clementine edition of the Vulgate became the standard Bible text of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, and remained so until 1979 when the Nova Vulgata was promulgated.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"5","iso":"lat","year":2009,"type":"book","provider":"Ronald L.
