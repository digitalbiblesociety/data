As an independent Jewish translation of the Hebrew Bible into English, Benisch's work offered the modern reader an accessible and culturally resonant rendition of the Old Testament. This translation was particularly notable for its intent to provide the Jewish community with an English version of the Scriptures that was both faithful to the original Hebrew texts and cognizant of contemporary linguistic nuances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbraham Benisch (1811â€“1878), a renowned scholar in Hebrew literature, embarked on this ambitious project to bridge the gap between ancient biblical texts and the modern English-speaking Jewish community. His dedication to Jewish education and culture was also evident in his two-decade tenure as the editor of the Jewish Chronicle. Benisch's translation not only facilitated a deeper understanding of the Scriptures among English-speaking Jews but also contributed significantly to the broader discourse on Jewish theology and biblical studies. His Jewish School and Family Bible remains a testament to his scholarly rigor and his commitment to making Jewish teachings more accessible.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"324","iso":"eng","year":1852,"type":"study","provider":"James Darling","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGJSF_DBS_HS/English-(1852)-Jewish-School-Family-Bible-Vol.-1-4-OT","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
