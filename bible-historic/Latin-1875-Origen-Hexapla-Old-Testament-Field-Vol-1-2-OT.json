This monumental work by Origen, a 3rd-century theologian, was a parallel collation of Greek versions of the Old Testament books. The Hexapla was estimated to span over 6,500 pages, making it too large for reproduction and leading to its scarcity. The original Hexapla was housed in the library of Pamphilus at Caesarea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile there have been significant advancements in Septuagint research since 1875 and scholars have acknowledged the need for an updated analysis of these fragments, Field's two-volume work continues to be the standard reference. This work is crucial for biblical studies, particularly in understanding the textual variations and translation history of the Old Testament.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"270","iso":"lat","year":1875,"type":"scan","provider":"E Typographeo Clarendoniano","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LATHEX_DBS_HS/Latin-(1875)-Origen-Hexapla-Old-Testament-(Field)-Vol-1-2-OT","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
