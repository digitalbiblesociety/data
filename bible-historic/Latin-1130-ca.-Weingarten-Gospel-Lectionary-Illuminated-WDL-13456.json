Weingarten Gospel Lectionary - Illuminated (WDL-13456)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Weingarten Gospel Lectionary, created around 1130, is a significant example of a lectionary - a liturgical book that differs from usual gospel books. Instead of containing the full texts of the gospels, it comprises only those portions of the gospels used for liturgical readings throughout the ecclesiastical year, arranged in chronological order.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis lectionary is adorned with two pen-and-ink-drawn initials, several decorated initials in gold and silver ink, and four full-page miniatures, each depicting one of the four Evangelists. The artistry, particularly in the style and coloring of the miniatures, is representative of the Bavarian tradition of book illumination, known as the Bavarian monastic school.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntended for the Altomünster Abbey in southern Bavaria, this manuscript was likely produced in the workshop of the Benedictine abbey of Weingarten. It stands as a testament to the religious and artistic culture of the period, reflecting the meticulous care and skilled craftsmanship that went into the creation of liturgical texts during the Middle Ages.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13456","filesize":"18","iso":"lat","year":1130,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATWEIN_DBS_HS/Latin-(1130-ca.)-Weingarten-Gospel-Lectionary-Illuminated-(WDL-13456)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
