This work, focusing on the first five books of the Old Testament, is part of a broader effort to make the scriptures accessible to Irish speakers, within a context where the language faced decline in favor of English. The inclusion of notes by MacHale, a prominent religious figure, adds scholarly and theological depth to the translation, assisting readers in understanding the text's religious and historical contexts. This edition of the Pentateuch is a testament to the ongoing efforts to preserve the Irish language, serving both as a religious text and a piece of cultural preservation. It underscores the role of the church and scholars in the linguistic and spiritual life of Ireland, aiming to keep the Irish language relevant in religious practice and study during a period of significant linguistic shift.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"37","iso":"gle","year":1859,"type":"scan","provider":"James Duffy","org_id":"","digitizer":"Google","archive_id":"GLEN27_DBS_HS/Irish-(1859)-Pentateuch-with-Notes-(John-MacHale)","language":{"iso":"gle","glotto_id":"iris1253","iso1":"ga","name":"Irish","autonym":"Standard Irish: Gaeilge","level":"L","location":"Ireland and United Kingdom","area":"Western isles northwest and southwest coasts; Galway, part of Mayo, Kerry, Donegal, Meath, Cork, Waterford, Scotland (Albain), Isle of Mann.
