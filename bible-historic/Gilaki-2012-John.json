Gilaki is closely related to Mazandarani and the two languages have similar vocabularies. Though the Persian language has influenced Gilaki to a great extent, Gilaki remains an independent language with a northwestern Iranian origin. The Gilaki and Mazandarani languages (but not other Iranian languages) share certain typological features with Caucasian languages (specifically South Caucasian languages), reflecting the history, ethnic identity, and close relatedness to the Caucasus region and Caucasian peoples of the Gilak people and Mazandarani people.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"229","iso":"glk","year":2012,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GLKGLK_DBS_HS/Gilaki-(2012)-John","language":{"iso":"glk","glotto_id":"gila1241","name":"Gilaki","autonym":"گیلکی ","level":"L","area":"Gilan region, coastal plain, south of Talish.
