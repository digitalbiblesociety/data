Pauper's Picture Bible - Illuminated (WDL-18195)","title_vernacular":"Bilderbibel der Armen (1050 ca., Illuminiert) (WDL-18195)","description":"The Paupers' Bible, or Biblia pauperum, a manuscript tradition flourishing from the 13th century, saw a significant surge in distribution in the late 15th century through block book and incunable editions. The 40-leaf Latin version emerged in 11 block book editions, influencing the German-language editions with simpler woodcuts. The first German block book edition was produced in 1470 by Friedrich Walther and Hans Hurning in NÃ¶rdlingen. A subsequent edition by Hans Sporer in Nuremberg in 1471 simplified the illustrations further. Unlike its predecessors, Sporer's edition allowed for printing on both sides of a page, suggesting a shift in production technique to use a printing press. This adaptation meant that the blocks were likely divided for easier printing, marking an evolution in the production of block books. Sporer's contributions to the block book tradition extended to three other titles until 1474, after which he transitioned to movable type printing in Bamberg in 1487. This edition of the Biblia pauperum underscores the transitional period in book production from block printing to the use of movable types, reflecting technological advancements in the printing industry of the time.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18183","filesize":"29","iso":"gmh","year":1050,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GMHPAUP_DBS_HS/German-Middle-(1050-ca.)-Pauper's-Picture-Bible-Illuminated-(WDL-18195)","language":{"iso":"gmh","glotto_id":"midd1343","name":"Middle High German (ca. 1050-1500)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
