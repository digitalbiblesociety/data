Schiaminossi Twelve Prophets (WDL-8919)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis small volume from the Bavarian State Library features depictions of 12 Old Testament prophets: Jeremiah, Moses, Zechariah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Isaiah, David, Amos, Jonah, Micah, Daniel, and Joel. The drawings, rendered in ink with dynamic flair, portray these monumental figures in wide, flowing cloaks, their expressions spiritual and engaging. Each leaf is signed RAF, attributed to Raffaello Schiaminossi (1572–1622), a Tuscan master of drawing and etching from Sansepolcro.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe volume is bound in beautiful red morocco leather with gold embossing, bearing the coat of arms of Pope Clement XI (1700–1721), known as Giovanni Francesco Albani, who owned an esteemed art collection in the Albani Palazzo del Drago alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. However, upon closer inspection, the drawings are revealed as copies of engravings by Schiaminossi, executed by a German artist. The binding, simpler than typical Roman bindings from the Albani library, suggests the work is an ingenious fake from around 1700, acquired by the Bavarian State Library via 19th-century art trade. The mystery surrounding this fake remains unsolved, adding intrigue to this fascinating artifact.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8919","filesize":"3","iso":"lat","year":1700,"type":"scan","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATSCHI_DBS_HS/Latin-(1700-ca.)-Schiaminossi-Twelve-Prophets-(WDL-8919)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
