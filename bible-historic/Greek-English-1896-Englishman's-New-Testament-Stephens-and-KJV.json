This work bridges the gap between the original Greek text and one of the most influential English translations of the Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Greek text in this edition is based on the 1550 version by Robert Stephens, a renowned 16th-century printer and scholar. Stephens' Greek text played a pivotal role in biblical scholarship, particularly influencing the development and standardization of the Greek New Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy presenting the Stephens text alongside the KJV, the \"Englishman's Greek New Testament\" provides a unique tool for comparative study. This parallel format allows readers and scholars to compare the original Greek with its translation in the KJV, offering insights into the translation process, textual variations, and the interpretation of biblical texts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis edition serves not only as a valuable resource for students of biblical languages but also for those interested in the history of biblical translation.
