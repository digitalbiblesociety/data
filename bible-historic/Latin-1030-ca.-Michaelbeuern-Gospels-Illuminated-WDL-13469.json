Michaelbeuern Gospels - Illuminated (WDL-13469)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Gospel book from the Benedictine monastery at Michaelbeuern is recognized as a product of the Salzburg school, evident in its stylistic similarities to other Salzburg manuscripts. Its arrival at Michaelbeuern, coinciding with the monastery's reestablishment from Saint Peter’s in Salzburg in the early 11th century or later, remains uncertain. In addition to canon tables and lesser initials, the manuscript is notable for its double leaves, an original part of the book, featuring four illustrations of the evangelists opposite ornamental initial pages. The evangelists are depicted with their long-winged symbols, set against bright colors on a pure gold background. The minimalist design, focusing on the evangelists and their symbols without additional elaborate details, draws attention to the relationship between the figures and their respective symbols.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13469","filesize":"46","iso":"lat","year":1030,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Monafterii Michael Burani","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATMICH_DBS_HS/Latin-(1030-ca.)-Michaelbeuern-Gospels-Illuminated-(WDL-13469)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
