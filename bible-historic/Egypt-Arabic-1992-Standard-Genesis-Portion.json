It is part of the Afro-Asiatic language family, and originated in the Nile Delta in Lower Egypt. The ca. 100 million Egyptians speak a continuum of dialects, among which Cairene is the most prominent. It is also understood across most of the Arabic-speaking countries due to broad Egyptian influence in the region, including through Egyptian cinema and Egyptian music. These factors help to make it the most widely spoken and by far the most widely studied variety of Arabic.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"330","iso":"arz","year":1992,"type":"genesis","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"ARZPOR_DBS_HS/Egypt-Arabic-(1992)-Standard-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"arz","glotto_id":"egyp1253","name":"Egyptian Arabic","autonym":"اللهجه المصريه","level":"L","location":"Egypt and Libya","area":"Also in Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Yemen.","country_id":"EG","latitude":31,"longitude":31,"population":68000000,"status_id":"3"}}
