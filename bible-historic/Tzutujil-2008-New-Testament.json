Tzʼutujil is closely related to its larger neighbors, Kaqchikel and Kʼicheʼ. The 2002 census found 60,000 people speak Tzʼutujil as their mother tongue. The two Tzʼutijil dialects are Eastern and Western.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe majority of the Tzʼutujil people have Spanish as their second language, although many of the older people or those in more remote locations do not. Many children also do not learn Spanish until they go to school around the age of five although more importance is now being placed upon it due to the influx of tourism into the region. As of 2012, the Community Library Rijaʼtzuul Naʼooj in San Juan La Laguna features storytelling for children in Tzʼutujil; bilingual children's books are also available. Spanish is used in written communication.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"3","iso":"tzj","year":2008,"type":"book","provider":"Wycliffe Bible Translators-La Sociedad Biblica de Nueva York Internacional","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"","archive_id":"TZJWES_DBS_HS/Tzutujil-(2008)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"tzj","glotto_id":"tzut1250","name":"Tz'utujil","autonym":"Tzʼutujiil","level":"L","location":"Guatemala","area":"Southern shore of Lake Atitlán, Sololá Department.","country_id":"GT","latitude":14.63507,"longitude":-91.20122,"population":106000}}
