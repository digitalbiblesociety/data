Eberhard Psalter - Illuminated (WDL-8960)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Eberhard Psalter, a masterpiece of Bavarian illumination from the first quarter of the 11th century, boasts 181 gold and silver initials, four picture pages on purple ground, and two miniature pages. Containing 150 psalms with commentaries, liturgical songs, and a confession of faith, it is named after Count Eberhard of Ebersberg (died circa 1041–45), who reportedly donated it to the Geisenfeld Benedictine convent he founded. The manuscript was commissioned by an unidentified Benedictine monk, depicted kneeling at the crucified Christ's feet in one of the miniatures (folio 6r). This monk is believed to be Reginbald, former Ebersberg abbot (died 1039), who later became abbot of Lorsch and bishop of Speyer. The originating scriptorium is unclear, but stylistic cues suggest a convent in southern or eastern Bavaria, possibly Niederaltaich during Abbot Godehard's tenure (died 1038). In 1803, the psalter was transferred to the Munich Court Library, now the Bavarian State Library, where it remains. This psalter is a vital artifact in the study of medieval manuscript illumination, representing religious devotion and artistic craftsmanship of its era.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8960","filesize":"287","iso":"lat","year":1025,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Psalteri Vmeberhardi Comitisdemvr","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATEBER_DBS_HS/Latin-(1025-ca.)-Eberhard-Psalter-Illuminated-(WDL-8960)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
