It was used across a wide geographic area including parts of modern-day Uzbekistan, Xinjiang, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Literary Chagatai is the predecessor of the modern Karluk branch of Turkic languages, which include Uzbek and Uyghur. Turkmen, which is not within the Karluk branch but in the Oghuz branch of Turkic languages, had been heavily influenced by Chagatai for centuries.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"314","iso":"uig","year":1950,"type":"genesis","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"UIGKGR_DBS_HS/Turki-(1950)-Genesis-Portion-(Eastern-Kasiigar-Turki)","language":{"iso":"uig","glotto_id":"uigh1243","iso1":"ug","name":"Uighur","autonym":"Uighur","level":"L","location":"China","country_id":"CN","latitude":43.67,"longitude":79.75,"population":10400000,"status_id":"2"}}
