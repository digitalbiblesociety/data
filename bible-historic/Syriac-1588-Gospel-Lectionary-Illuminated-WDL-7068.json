The manuscript, written in Serto script for the main text and Estrangela for section titles, features two columns per page with 22 lines each. The black ink used for letters and red for titles and diacritical points has remained crisp over time, with little fading. The Estrangela script, the oldest Syriac script, occasionally appears in blue ink. The manuscript includes colorful tables with circular designs for the readings, and an ornately designed title page. Syriac, an eastern Aramaic dialect, was the language of Christians in regions stretching from the Roman Empire to the Arabian Sea from the first to the 12th century.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7068","filesize":"97","iso":"syr","year":1588,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"SYRGOSP_DBS_HS/Syriac-(1588)-Gospel-Lectionary-Illuminated(WDL-7068)","language":{"iso":"syr","glotto_id":"syr","name":"Syriac","level":"L","country_id":"IQ","population":858080}}
