By Isaac Leeser. Philadelphia, 1853.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIsaac Leeser (1806-1868) was a leading figure among American Jews during the 1840’s and 50’s. He was born in Germany, and came to America at the age of seventeen. He was a devout Jew, and became the cantor of his congregation, and shortly thereafter the regular preacher. He was the first to preach sermons in English from the lecturn. He devoted himself to educational projects, became prominent as a writer and publisher of Jewish books, and, perhaps most important of all, founded and edited a monthly Jewish magazine, called The Occident and American Jewish Advocate. His Twenty-four Books of the Holy Scriptures (published by himself in 1853) was a revision of the King James Version, in which he aimed to substitute Jewish for Christian interpretations, and generally to improve the accuracy of the version.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"33","iso":"eng","year":1853,"type":"scan","provider":"Hebrew Publishing Company","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGTHB_DBS_HS/English-(1853)-Tanach-Hebrew-Bible-(Leeser)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
