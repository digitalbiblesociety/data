The end of the Medieval Greek period and the beginning of Modern Greek is often symbolically assigned to the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, even though that date marks no clear linguistic boundary and many characteristic features of the modern language arose centuries earlier, beginning around the fourth century AD.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"6","iso":"ell","year":1991,"type":"book","provider":"G.
