According to Ethnologue, seven varieties of Romani are divergent enough to be considered languages of their own. The largest of these are Vlax Romani (about 500,000 speakers), Balkan Romani (600,000), and Sinte Romani (300,000). Some Romani communities speak mixed languages based on the surrounding language with retained Romani-derived vocabulary – these are known by linguists as Para-Romani varieties, rather than dialects of the Romani language itself.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"240","iso":"rmy","year":1996,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"RMYRMY_DBS_HS/Romani-Lashi-Viasta-John-(print)","language":{"iso":"rmy","glotto_id":"vlax1238","name":"Vlax Romani","autonym":"řomani čhib","level":"L","area":"Also in Albania, Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"RO","latitude":46.819124,"longitude":14.845093,"population":8500000,"status_id":"6b"}}
