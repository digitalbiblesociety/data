This seminal work, the first major book printed using movable metal type in Western Europe, signifies the transition from the Middle Ages to the modern world. Johann Gutenberg, who lived from about 1397 to 1468, is renowned for inventing the process of making uniform and interchangeable metal type, thereby revolutionizing printing. The Bible's text is the Latin Vulgate, translated by Saint Jerome in the fourth century, and is noted for its noble Gothic type, a hallmark of fine printing and craftsmanship. It is predominantly printed in double columns with 42 lines per page, and the capital letters and headings are hand-ornamented in color. The three volumes are bound in 16th-century white pigskin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Library of Congress's copy, entirely printed on vellum—a fine parchment made from animal skin—is one of only three perfect vellum copies known, the others being in the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the British Library. This Bible was under the Benedictine Order's care for nearly five centuries, housed in the Abbey of Saint Blasius in Germany's Black Forest and later, post-1809, in the Abbey of Saint Paul in Carinthia, Austria. Each volume contains the Abbey of Saint Blasius's bookplate. The Library of Congress acquired this Bible, along with other 15th-century books, from Dr. Otto H. F. Vollbehr in 1930 through an act of Congress.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7782","filesize":"112","iso":"lat","year":1455,"type":"scan","provider":"Bibliothecae Princ.
