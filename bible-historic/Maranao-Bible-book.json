Because of the mass influx of Cebuano migrants to Mindanao, many Maranaos are also fluent in Cebuano.  Arabic, a Central Semitic language, is spoken by a minority of the Moro people, as it is the liturgical language of Islam. Most Maranaos, however, do not know Arabic beyond its religious use.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"7","iso":"mrw","year":2013,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MRWNVS_DBS_HS/Maranao-Bible-(book)","language":{"iso":"mrw","glotto_id":"mara1404","name":"Maranao","autonym":"Mëranaw","level":"L","location":"Southern Philippines","area":"Mindanao, Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur provinces.","country_id":"PH","latitude":7.79414,"longitude":124.17548,"population":866000,"status_id":"5"}}
