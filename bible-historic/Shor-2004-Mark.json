Presently, not all ethnic Shors speak Shor and the language suffered a decline from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. During this period the Shor language was neither written nor taught in schools. However, since the 1980s and 1990s there has been a Shor language revival. The language is now taught at the Novokuznetsk branch of the Kemerovo State University.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"424","iso":"cjs","year":2004,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"CJSIBT_DBS_HS/Shuwa-Luke-(print)","language":{"iso":"cjs","glotto_id":"shor1247","name":"Shor","autonym":"Шор тили","level":"L","location":"Central Russia","area":"Altai Krai, Khakass Ao and Gorno-Altai Ao, on River Tomy.","country_id":"RU","latitude":52.32607,"longitude":88.4344,"population":6210,"status_id":"6b"}}
