Corvey Gospel Fragment - Illuminated (WDL-13017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis manuscript fragment, comprising four folios, is from a Gospel book likely produced at the Corvey monastery in western Germany in the mid-to-late 10th century, during the reign of Otto I. These pages are esteemed examples of early Ottonian manuscript illumination, distinguished by their lavish ornamentation. Introducing the Gospels of Luke and John, the pages feature gold and jewel-toned colors set against dyed purple backgrounds. The design integrates monumental classicizing square capitals on these purple grounds with intricate interlace patterns. This fragment includes the opening pages of Luke (folios 93−94) and John (folios 137−38), which were initially part of a Gospel book housed in the Chapter Library of the Cathedral of Rheims. This book remained there until the French Revolution, when it was seized along with other manuscripts. The Corvey Gospel Fragment is related to manuscripts such as those in the Pierpont Morgan Library (Ms. M. 755) and the New York Public Library, demonstrating the spread and influence of the Ottonian style in manuscript illumination across Europe.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13017","filesize":"3","iso":"lat","year":900,"type":"illuminated","provider":"MS.
