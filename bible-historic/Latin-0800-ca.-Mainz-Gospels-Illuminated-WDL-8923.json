Mainz Gospels - Illuminated (WDL-8923)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis renowned Carolingian gospel, likely written in the Mainz scriptorium in the early ninth century, is notable for its elaborate decoration. It features canon tables in the form of arcades, vividly painted in red, green, greyish blue, violet, yellow, and ochre, with architectural frames adorned with floral and geometrical patterns. All four evangelists' portraits are preserved, likely executed by two different painters. The canon tables and portraits of Matthew and John seem to be modeled after the Ada Gospels in the Trier municipal library, while the other portraits might be based on a model similar to the southern English Codex Aureus in the Royal Library of Stockholm.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe style of most larger initials, showing southern English influence, aligns with the manuscript's presumed origin in the Mainz–Hersfeld area of Hesse in central Germany. This region was pivotal in the Anglo-Saxon mission to the continent in the eighth century. Mainz, the archiepiscopal seat of Saint Boniface, the \"Apostle of the Germans,\" and the Hersfeld Benedictine monastery, founded by two of Boniface's disciples, were central to this cultural and religious exchange.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8923","filesize":"58","iso":"lat","year":800,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATMAIN_DBS_HS/Latin-(0800-ca.)-Mainz-Gospels-Illuminated-(WDL-8923)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
