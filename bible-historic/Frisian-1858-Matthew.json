The Frisians are a people of Anglo-Saxon stock, and their language is closely related to English. Frisian proper is still spoken by about 250,000 Frisians. (Almost half the population of Friesland is Dutch- speaking.) Frisian, a Germanic tongue, is spoken in three distinct dialects Western, or Frisian proper, Eastern, and Northern.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the term Walloon is sometimes used to describe all the 4 million French-speaking Belgians (as distinguished from the Flemish), the Walloon dialect actually connotes the French spoken around Liege, in southeastern Belgium. It was there that the 19th-century movement to develop a Walloon literature was strongest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1755 Psalms Leeuwarden Translated in part by GijsbcrtJapiks andfinished by Simon andJan Althuysen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1858 Matthew Printed privately, London Translated by Joost H.
