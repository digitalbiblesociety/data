{"id":"English-1731-Wycliffe-New-Testament","abbr":"ENGWYC","title":"English (1731) Wycliffe New Testament","title_vernacular":"","description":"The Wycliffe New Testament, initially translated from the Latin Vulgate into English by John Wycliffe, is a historically significant text. The 1731 edition is particularly noteworthy as it represents the earliest printed edition of Wycliffeâ€™s New Testament. The complete version of Wycliffe's Bible, including the Old Testament, was not published until the mid-nineteenth century. Wycliffe's translation is considered a pioneering work, likely being the first translation of the Bible into English. However, his efforts were not well received by the Catholics and Englishmen of his time. After his death, Wycliffe was declared a heretic, and his body and writings were burned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis 1731 edition contains portraits of John Wycliffe and John Lewis, the publisher. It also includes an eight-page glossary of terms and several facsimiles from sixteenth-century Bibles. Notably, only 160 copies of this edition were issued, making it a rare and valuable piece of religious and historical literature. The publication of this edition signifies the enduring impact of Wycliffe's work and the evolving perceptions of his contributions to biblical scholarship and translation.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"48","iso":"eng","year":1731,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGWYC_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
