'Text of the Tradition') is the authoritative Hebrew and Aramaic text of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) in Rabbinic Judaism. The Masoretic Text defines the Jewish canon and its precise letter text, with its vocalization and accentuation known as the mas'sora. Referring to the Masoretic Text, Mesorah specifically means the diacritic markings of the text of the Hebrew scriptures and the concise marginal notes in manuscripts (and later printings) of the Tanakh which note textual details, usually about the precise spelling of words. It was primarily copied, edited, and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era (CE). The oldest known complete copy, the Leningrad Codex, dates from the early 11th century CE.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"14","iso":"heb","year":2005,"type":"book","provider":"Bibles.org.uk","org_id":"Bibles.org.uk","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HEBOMT_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(2005)-Old-Testament-OT-Massoretic-Text","language":{"iso":"heb","glotto_id":"hebr1245","iso1":"he","name":"Hebrew","autonym":"Israeli Hebrew","level":"L","area":"Also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, Panama, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.10565,"longitude":35.01788,"population":5000000,"status_id":"1"}}
