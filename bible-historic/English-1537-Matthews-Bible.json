{"id":"English-1537-Matthews-Bible","abbr":"ENGMTB","title":"English (1537) Matthews Bible","title_vernacular":"","description":"The Matthew Bible, also known as Matthew's Version, is a significant historical text in the lineage of English Bible translations. First published in 1537 by John Rogers, using the pseudonym \"Thomas Matthew,\" this Bible occupies a crucial position in the evolution of English scriptures. It amalgamated the New Testament, translated by William Tyndale, with the sections of the Old Testament that Tyndale had managed to complete before his capture and execution. The translation of the remaining portions of the Old Testament and the Biblical Apocrypha was undertaken by Myles Coverdale, who primarily relied on German and Latin texts. However, the Prayer of Manasseh was translated by Rogers himself and incorporated into the Coverdale Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis publication stands as a pivotal connection in the series of English Bible translations, seamlessly merging the works of Tyndale and Coverdale. The Matthew Bible is particularly notable because it represents a collaborative effort that brought together the translations of these two prominent figures, bridging the gap between Tyndale's pioneering work and the subsequent translations that would follow. The Matthew Bible's influence extends beyond its initial publication, as it served as a foundational text for later translations and significantly impacted the development of the English language and religious literature.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"7","iso":"eng","year":1537,"type":"scan","provider":"GreatSite.com","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGMTB_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
