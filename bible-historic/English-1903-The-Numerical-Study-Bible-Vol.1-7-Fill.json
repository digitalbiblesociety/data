Grant's \"The Numerical Bible,\" a seven-volume exploration, presents a unique perspective on the structure and symbolism of the Scriptures. Grant's work stands out for its compelling argument that the Bible, far from being a collection of fragmented literary pieces or forgeries, is a coherent and divinely inspired work, meticulously structured and symbolically rich. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Grant draws parallels between the organization of the Bible and the natural world. He posits that just as the natural universe is underpinned by mathematical precision and numeric laws, so too is the structure of the Scripture. This fascinating correlation suggests that the order, structure, and symbolic dimensions of the Bible are not random but reflect a higher divine order. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \"The Numerical Bible\" delves into the idea that numbers and the structural design of the Bible are not mere literary tools but carry elements of divine revelation themselves. This perspective offers a new lens through which to view the Bible, not just as a spiritual guide but also as a reflection of the intrinsic order and beauty of the universe. Grant's work invites readers to see the Bible as a part of the natural order, intricately woven with purpose and intentionality that mirror the fundamental laws governing the world.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"300","iso":"eng","year":1903,"type":"study","provider":"Loizeaux Brothers, Bible Truth Depot","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGKJV_DBS_HS/English-(1903)-The-Numerical-Study-Bible-Vol.1-7-Fill","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
