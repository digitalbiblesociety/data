The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland approved this text for use in 1650, and it has been in continuous use ever since. The Psalter, known for its enduring relevance, has remained largely unchanged from its original form, except for some modernization of the spelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe 1650 Psalter was primarily the work of Francis Rous, who completed his version around 1644. However, before its final approval for use in the Scottish church, the text underwent six years of rigorous scrutiny and revision. This process was undertaken by two different groups of highly learned and devout church leaders, ensuring that each word and phrase was faithfully aligned with the original Hebrew texts. This meticulous approach to translation and revision underscores the Psalter's significance and the dedication to preserving the integrity of the scriptural texts.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"37","iso":"eng","year":1635,"type":"reprint","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENG1650_DBS_HS/English-(1635)-Scottish-Metrical-Psalter-(1864-Reprint)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
