{"id":"Aneityum-Psalms-book","abbr":"ATYPSA","title":"Aneityum - Psalms (Book)","title_vernacular":"Aneityum - Salamo (Nwoma)","description":"The Aneityum translation of the Book of Psalms is a significant cultural and linguistic endeavor, highlighting the importance of making religious texts accessible to diverse linguistic communities. Aneityum, the language spoken on the island of Vanuatu, is unique to its native community. This translation project underscores the commitment to preserving and celebrating the Aneityum language and culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Book of Psalms, a revered collection of hymns, prayers, and poems within the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament, holds deep spiritual significance. By translating it into Aneityum, the translators have enabled the local community to engage with these sacred texts in their native tongue, enhancing their spiritual and cultural experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis translation initiative is particularly vital given the smaller number of Aneityum speakers. Projects like these are key to maintaining the vibrancy and continuity of less commonly spoken languages, contributing to the richness of global linguistic diversity. The Aneityum translation of the Psalms is not only a tool for spiritual reflection but also a testament to the resilience and enduring value of indigenous languages and cultures.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"23","iso":"aty","year":1905,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ATYPSA_DBS_HS/Aneityum-Psalms-(book)","language":{"iso":"aty","glotto_id":"anei1239","name":"Aneityum","autonym":"Aneiteum","level":"L","location":"Vanuatu","area":"Aneityum Island.","country_id":"VU","latitude":-20.18636,"longitude":169.82523,"population":900,"status_id":"5"}}
