It should not be confused with Tatar proper, spoken in Tatarstan and adjacent regions in Russia; the languages are related, but belong to two different subgroups of the Kipchak languages and thus are not mutually intelligible. It has been extensively influenced by nearby Oghuz dialects.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"2","iso":"crh","year":2016,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"CRHIBT_DBS_HS/Tatar-Crimean-John-(book)","language":{"iso":"crh","glotto_id":"crim1257","name":"Crimean Tatar","autonym":"Crimean","level":"L","location":"Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan","area":"Crimea.
