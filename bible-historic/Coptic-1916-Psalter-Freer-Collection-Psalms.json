Sometimes called Neo-Egyptian, it is a development of Ancient Egyptian, in use until the 6th century B.C., and it's later Hieratic and Demotic forms. These long succeeding periods made Coptic the living language with the longest recorded history. The few remaining Coptic speakers succumbed to the Arabic language in the 17th century.\u003cbr\u003eCoptic was spoken in several dialects. Scriptures are extant in the Bohairic (Coastal, Lower Egypt); Fayumic or Bashmuric, Sub- Achmimic, and Middle Egyptian; and Sahidic and Achmimic (Upper Egyptian) dialects. Bohairic, earlier known as Memphitic, was the usage of Alexandria and hence survives as the ecclesiastical and liturgical language of the Coptic Church. However, it appears that Scriptures first appeared (3rd century) in Sahidic, because Lower Egypt had been Hellenized and the Greek Scriptures could be used there. Although considerable research remains to be done on the Coptic texts, these early versions cast light on the text used by the early Church.\u003cbr\u003eThe Coptic alphabet employs 24 Greek characters and 7 characters retained from Demotic script.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"6","iso":"cop","year":1916,"type":"scan","provider":"Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner \u0026 Co.
