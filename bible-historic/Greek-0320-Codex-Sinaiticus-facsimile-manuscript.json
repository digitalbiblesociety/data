{"id":"Greek-0320-Codex-Sinaiticus-facsimile-manuscript","abbr":"GRCSINA","title":"Greek (0320) Codex Sinaiticus facsimile manuscript","title_vernacular":"Κώδικας Σιναϊτικός (0320, χειρόγραφο ομοίωμα)","description":"The Codex Sinaiticus, dating to around 320–350 AD, is one of the oldest and most complete manuscripts of the Christian Bible in Greek. Written on vellum (parchment) in uncial script, it contains large portions of both the Old Testament (Septuagint) and the New Testament, making it a critical resource for biblical scholarship and the study of early Christianity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe manuscript was discovered in the mid-19th century at Saint Catherine’s Monastery on Mount Sinai by Constantin von Tischendorf, a German biblical scholar. It is considered one of the four great uncial codices, alongside Codex Vaticanus, Codex Alexandrinus, and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus. Unlike later medieval manuscripts, Codex Sinaiticus does not follow the Byzantine text-type, but rather exhibits a more diverse and ancient textual tradition, making it invaluable for reconstructing the earliest forms of the Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA facsimile edition of Codex Sinaiticus refers to a precise reproduction of the original manuscript, allowing scholars, institutions, and collectors to study its contents without needing access to the fragile and priceless original. These facsimiles are produced using high-resolution photography and meticulous printing techniques, ensuring that even damaged sections, corrections, and marginal notes remain visible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe manuscript originally contained the entire Bible, but over the centuries, some portions have been lost. It is written in four columns per page, an unusual format for ancient biblical manuscripts, suggesting that it was a lavish and expensive production, possibly commissioned for imperial or ecclesiastical use. It also includes books not found in later biblical canons, such as the Shepherd of Hermas and the Epistle of Barnabas, highlighting the diversity of early Christian scripture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, Codex Sinaiticus is split across multiple locations: the British Library (London), Leipzig University Library, the National Library of Russia (St. Petersburg), and Saint Catherine’s Monastery. Digital facsimiles are now widely available, allowing scholars and the public to explore this foundational biblical manuscript, which continues to shape textual criticism, theology, and the understanding of early Christian scripture.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"53","iso":"grc","year":320,"type":"manuscript","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
