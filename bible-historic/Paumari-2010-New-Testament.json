{"id":"Paumari-2010-New-Testament","abbr":"PADWBT","title":"Paumari (2010) New Testament","title_vernacular":"Paumari (2010) Hakatagi Warikyai","description":"Paumarí (also Paumari, Purupuru, Kurukuru, Pamari, Purupurú, Pammari, Curucuru, Palmari) is an Arauan language spoken in Brazil by about 300 older adults out of an ethnic population of 900. It is spoken by the Paumari Indians, who call their language “Pamoari”. The word “Pamoari” has several different meanings in the Paumarí language: ‘man,’ ‘people,’ ‘human being,’ and ‘client.’ These multiple meanings stem from their different relationships with outsiders; presumably, it means ‘human being’ when they refer to themselves as someone of ostensibly equal status, and ‘client’ when referring to their people among river traders and Portuguese speakers.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"6","iso":"pad","year":2010,"type":"book","provider":"Wycliffe-Liga Biblica Internacional","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"","archive_id":"PADWBT_DBS_HS/Paumari-(2010)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"pad","glotto_id":"paum1247","name":"Paumarí","level":"L","location":"Western Central Brazil","country_id":"BR","latitude":-5.78403,"longitude":-64.28035,"population":290,"status_id":"7"}}
