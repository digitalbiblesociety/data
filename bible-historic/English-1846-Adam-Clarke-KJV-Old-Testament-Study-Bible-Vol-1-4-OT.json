He is best remembered for his extensive commentary on the Bible, a monumental work that took him four decades to complete. This commentary has been a cornerstone of Methodist theological resources for over two centuries. Clarke, a devout theologian, upheld and expanded upon the teachings of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. He believed fervently in the Bible as the ultimate guide to understanding God's nature and intentions. Clarke viewed the Scriptures as a divine grace, capable of dispelling the darkness of ignorance. His approach to theology was fundamentally rooted in the Bible, and he often expressed reservations about purely systematic theological methods, preferring instead the direct interpretation of the biblical texts.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"457","iso":"eng","year":1846,"type":"study","provider":"G.
