{"id":"Efate-1874-South-Genesis-Portion","abbr":"ERKPOR","title":"Efate (1874) South Genesis Portion","title_vernacular":"Efate South (1874) Genesis Wana","description":"The Nafsan language, also known as South Efate or Erakor, is a Southern Oceanic language spoken on the island of Efate in central Vanuatu. As of 2005, there are approximately 6,000 speakers who live in coastal villages from Pango to Eton. The language's grammar has been studied by Nick Thieberger, who is working on a book of stories and a dictionary of the language.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNafsan is closely related to Nguna and to Lelepa. Based on shared features with southern Vanuatu languages (including echoâ€“subject marking, and the free and preposed 1st-singular-possessive morphemes), Lynch (2001) suggests it could form part of a southern Vanuatu subgroup that includes New Caledonia.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"409","iso":"erk","year":1874,"type":"genesis","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"ERKPOR_DBS_HS/Efate-(1874)-South-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"erk","glotto_id":"sout2856","name":"South Efate","autonym":"South Efate","level":"L","location":"Vanuatu","area":"Efate Island.","country_id":"VU","latitude":-17.70063,"longitude":168.37659,"population":6000,"status_id":"5"}}
