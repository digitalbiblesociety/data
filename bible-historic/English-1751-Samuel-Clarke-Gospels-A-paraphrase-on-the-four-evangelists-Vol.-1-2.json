Educated at the free school of Norwich and at Caius College, Cambridge, Clarke made significant contributions to religious literature. In 1699, he published \"Three Practical Essays on Baptism, Confirmation and Repentance\" and \"Some Reflections on that part of a book called Amyntor, or a Defence of Milton's Life,\" which relates to the Writings of the Primitive Fathers and the Canon of the New Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1701, Clarke began a series of paraphrases on the Gospels, starting with the Gospel of St Matthew. This work was followed by paraphrases on the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke in 1702, and shortly afterwards by a volume on St John. These works were later compiled and printed together in two volumes, which have gone through several editions since their initial publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClarke had ambitions to paraphrase the remaining books of the New Testament in a similar manner. However, this goal remained unfulfilled at the time of his passing. His paraphrases on the four evangelists are remembered for their clarity and insight, reflecting his profound understanding of biblical texts and contributing to theological and biblical studies.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"335","iso":"eng","year":1751,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGSCB_DBS_HS/English-(1751)-Samuel-Clarke-Gospels-(A-paraphrase-on-the-four-evangelists)-Vol.-1-2","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
