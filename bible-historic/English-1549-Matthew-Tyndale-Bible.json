{"id":"English-1549-Matthew-Tyndale-Bible","abbr":"ENGMTB","title":"English (1549) Matthew-Tyndale Bible","title_vernacular":"","description":"The Matthew Bible, also known as Matthew's Version, was first published in 1537 by John Rogers under the pseudonym \"Thomas Matthew\". It combined the New Testament of William Tyndale, and as much of the Old Testament as he had been able to translate before being captured and put to death. Myles Coverdale translated chiefly from German and Latin sources and completed the Old Testament and Biblical Apocrypha, except for the Prayer of Manasseh, which was Rogers', into the Coverdale Bible. It is thus a vital link in the main sequence of English Bible translations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis version of the Bible is significant for its role in consolidating the translations of Tyndale and Coverdale. Rogers, under his pseudonym, managed to bring together Tyndale's translations of the New Testament and portions of the Old Testament with Coverdale's additional translations from various sources. This amalgamation formed a more complete version of the Bible in English at a time when access to the scriptures in the vernacular was increasingly sought after. The Matthew Bible, therefore, stands as a crucial step in the evolution of Bible translations in English, bridging the gap between the early works of Tyndale and the more comprehensive translations that would follow in its wake.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"554","iso":"eng","year":1549,"type":"scan","provider":"GreatSite.com","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGMTB_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
