On some islands, it has now largely been replaced by Torres Strait Creole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore colonization in the 1870sâ€“1880s, the language was the major lingua franca of the Torres Strait cultural area of Northern Cape York Australia, Torres Strait and along the coast of the Western Province/Papua New Guinea. It is still fairly widely spoken by neighboring Papuans and by some Aboriginal Australians. How many non-first language speakers it has is unknown.
