{"id":"Urdu-Latin-New-Testament-print","abbr":"URDFGB","title":"Urdu (Latin) New Testament (Print)","title_vernacular":"Urdu (Latin) - Naya Ahd Nama","description":"Urdu is an Indo-Aryan language spoken chiefly in South Asia. It is the national language and lingua franca of Pakistan, where it is also an official language alongside English. In India, Urdu is an Eighth Schedule language whose status and cultural heritage are recognized by the Constitution of India; it also has official status in several Indian states. In Nepal, Urdu is a registered regional dialect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Urdu language has been described as a Persianised register of the Hindustani language; Urdu and Hindi share a common Sanskrit- and Prakrit-derived vocabulary base, phonology, syntax, and grammar, making them mutually intelligible during colloquial communication. While formal Urdu draws literary, political, and technical vocabulary from Persian, formal Hindi draws these aspects from Sanskrit; consequently, the two languages' mutual intelligibility effectively decreases as the factor of formality increases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArabic Script unless noted:  1805 Gospels (Devanagari character) Hindoostanee Press, Calcutta Translated by Mirza Fitrut and William Hunter of the College of Fort William.
