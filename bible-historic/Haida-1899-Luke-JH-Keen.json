These Indians are culturally related to the Zimshian and Tlingit. Numbering about 10,000 in the early 19th century, by 1900 they were reduced by disease to no more than 2,000. Their language, considered to be a separate Nadene tongue, was originally spoken in several regional dialects. Most of the Haida now speak English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1891 Matthew BFBS, London Translated by Charles Harrison, Church MS;1898 Acts Translated by John J.H.
