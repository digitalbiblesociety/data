Passau Gospel - Illuminated (WDL-14707)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProduced around 1150 in Passau, Germany, this manuscript Gospel book is a remarkable artifact, standing out in the manuscript production of its time and place. The Gospel book features eight pages of highly elaborate canon tables, followed by four full-page pictures of the seated Evangelists, rendered in a three-dimensional style. In the 15th century, the manuscript was bound in covers of gold-plated brass, with the front cover prominently featuring a rock crystal Madonna on the throne. Additionally, medallions with the symbols of the Evangelists, engraved below glass, were added to the corners of the front cover. Originally belonging to the Saint Nicholas monastery in Passau, the manuscript was transferred to Munich around 1803 or 1804. This Gospel book is a significant example of the artistic and religious craftsmanship of the medieval period.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/14707","filesize":"71","iso":"lat","year":1150,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATPASS_DBS_HS/Latin-(1150-ca.)-Passau-Gospel-Illuminated-(WDL-14707)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
