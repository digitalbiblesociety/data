It is spoken mainly in Russia, as well as in Turkey, Jordan, Syria, and Israel, where they settled after the Circassian genocide. It is closely related to the Kabardian (East Circassian) language, though some reject the distinction between the two languages in favor of both being dialects of a unitary Circassian language.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"4","iso":"ady","year":1992,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ady_nt","language":{"iso":"ady","glotto_id":"adyg1241","name":"Adyghe","autonym":"West Circassian","level":"L","location":"Jordan and Syria","area":"Adygea Republic.
