(WDL-21766)","description":"The Codex Beratinus Purpureus Phi, also known as Codex of Berat number 1 (Gregory-Aland no. 043), is a significant 6th-century manuscript. Believed to have been copied during the reign of Byzantine Emperor Justinian the Great (circa 483–565, reigned 527–65), it was created in an imperial scriptorium, likely in Constantinople or somewhere along the shores of Asia Minor. This manuscript contains the Gospels of Matthew and Mark in their original Greek and is esteemed as the oldest written document housed at the Central State Archive in Tirana, Albania.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts journey to Berat, south-central Albania, where it was present since 1356, remains a mystery. The manuscript faced threats during the Communist regime in Albania post-World War II, leading to its concealment in the cathedral church of Berat alongside the Codex Aureus Anthimi. Rediscovered in 1968 after nearly being destroyed by humidity, it underwent restoration in 1971 at the Institute of Archeology in Beijing, China.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its return to Albania in January 1972, the Codex Beratinus Purpureus Phi has been preserved in Tirana. In 2005, it was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register alongside Codex Aureus Anthimi, highlighting its global cultural significance. The manuscript comprises 190 folios on purple parchment, written in Greek majuscule letters in two columns with 17 lines per page. Notably, the ink is silver and gold, with gold reserved exclusively for the nomina sacra. Its embossed metal plate covers, produced in 1805, were probably attached during a restoration at that time, adding to its historical and aesthetic value.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/18191","filesize":"58","iso":"grc","year":565,"type":"manuscript","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GRCBERA_DBS_HS/Greek-(0565-ca.)-Codex-Beratinus-Purpureus-Phi-(WDL-21766)","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
