Thomas Sheldon Green, M.A., is a notable contribution to the field of New Testament studies. Published in London by Samuel Bagster and Sons, this work presents a unique parallel-column format featuring both a new translation and a newly formed text of the Greek New Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRev. Thomas Sheldon Green, a late Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, was already known for his \"Treatise on the Grammar of the New Testament.\" In this publication, he offered a new translation of the Greek Testament, accompanied by a critical edition of the original text. The title \"The Twofold New Testament\" aptly reflects the dual nature of this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreen's work is significant for providing readers with an accessible English translation alongside the Greek text, allowing for a direct comparison between the original language and its English rendition. This parallel presentation is especially valuable for students of biblical languages and scholars interested in textual criticism and the translation process of the New Testament. Green's translation and critical text offer insights into the linguistic and contextual nuances of the New Testament, contributing to a deeper understanding of its teachings and historical background.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"37","iso":"grc","year":1864,"type":"study","provider":"Samuel Bagster and Sons","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCTFP_DBS_HS/Greek-English-(1864)-TwoFold-Parallel-New-Testament-(Green)","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
