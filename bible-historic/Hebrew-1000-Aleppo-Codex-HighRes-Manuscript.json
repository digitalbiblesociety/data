Written in Tiberias in the 10th century CE (circa 920) during the Abbasid Caliphate era, it is particularly renowned for its accuracy, a feature that was endorsed by the famed Jewish philosopher and scholar Maimonides. The Aleppo Codex, along with the Leningrad Codex, represents the Ben-Asher Masoretic tradition, a key textual tradition in the history of the Hebrew Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor five centuries, the codex was kept in the Central Synagogue of Aleppo. However, in 1947, during anti-Jewish riots, the synagogue was torched, leading to the codex's partial destruction. Its whereabouts remained largely unknown until it resurfaced in Israel in 1958, with about 40% of the manuscript, including most of the Torah section, missing. Only two additional leaves have been recovered since. The initial belief that the missing pages were destroyed in the synagogue fire has been increasingly questioned, leading to speculation that they might still exist in private collections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe remaining portion of the Aleppo Codex is currently housed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. Despite its partial loss, the codex remains one of the most important manuscripts for the study of the Hebrew Bible, offering invaluable insights into the Masoretic textual tradition and the history of biblical texts.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"119","iso":"hbo","year":1000,"type":"manuscript","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HBOALEP_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1000)-Aleppo-Codex-(HighRes)-Manuscript","language":{"iso":"hbo","glotto_id":"anci1244","name":"Ancient Hebrew","autonym":"עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית","level":"H","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.77607,"longitude":35.17248,"status_id":"9"}}
