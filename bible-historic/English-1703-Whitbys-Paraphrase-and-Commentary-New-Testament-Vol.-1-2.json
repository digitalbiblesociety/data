Whitby (1638â€“1726), a controversial English theologian and Arminian priest in the Church of England, was known for his strong anti-Calvinistic views and later indications of Unitarian tendencies. His major work, this paraphrase and commentary, began in 1688 and was first published in 1700, with the final edition released in 1822.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhitby's commentary, printed in London in 1703 by W. Bowyer for Awnsham and John Churchill, was held in high regard; Philip Doddridge, another respected theologian, considered it superior to other contemporaneous commentaries. Whitby's approach in this work included opposing John Tillotson's views on hell torments and defining faith as mere assent to the facts of the Gospel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1710, Whitby engaged in a critical defense of the Textus Receptus, challenging John Mill's work, which presented thirty thousand textual variants in the New Testament. Whitby's critique, \"Examen variantium Lectionum Johannis Milli,\" was used by Anthony Collins and was reprinted in 1724 by Sigebert Haverkamp in Leyden. Whitby's work not only reflects the theological and interpretive debates of his time but also contributes to the historical understanding of New Testament scholarship.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"279","iso":"eng","year":1703,"type":"study","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGWHI_DBS_HS/English-(1703)-Whitbys-Paraphrase-and-Commentary-New-Testament-(Vol.-1-2)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
