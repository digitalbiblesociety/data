More than 6 million Iranians speak Azerbai- jani, Kurdish, and Armenian as well.

The Aryan ancestors of the present-day Iranians settled there about 2000 B.C. and soon divided into the Medes and Persians. The Persian Empire, founded by King Cyrus about 550 B.C., was the short-lived but glorious beginning of Persian political history.
