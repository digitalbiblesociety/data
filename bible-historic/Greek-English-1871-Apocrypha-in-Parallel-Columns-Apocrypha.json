Fritzsche, a German Protestant theologian born on September 23, 1812, in Dobrilugk, was recognized for his significant contributions to theological studies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFritzsche's academic journey began at the University of Halle, where he obtained his habilitation in 1836. He joined the University of Zurich as an associate professor of theology in 1837, later becoming a titular professor in 1842 and a full professor in 1860. Besides his academic roles, he served as the chief librarian at the cantonal library from 1844 until his death.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis work on the Apocrypha, providing Greek and English texts in parallel columns, is particularly important for those studying these intertestamental books, which are included in the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate but are not part of the Hebrew Bible. Fritzsche's edition allows for a comparative study of the texts, offering insights into the translation and interpretation of the Apocrypha. This work reflects his deep engagement with theological studies and his commitment to making religious texts accessible for scholarly examination.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"19","iso":"grc","year":1871,"type":"scan","provider":"Samuel Bagster and Sons","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCSEPT_DBS_HS/Greek-English-(1871)-Apocrypha-in-Parallel-Columns-Apocrypha","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
