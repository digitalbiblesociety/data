Its closest relatives are Ronga and Tsonga, the three forming the Tswaâ€“Ronga family of languages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTswa is mainly spoken in the rural areas west of Inhambane. Its largest dialect, Hlengwe, extends westwards to Southern Zimbabwe; Maho (2009) considers this to be a distinct language. The other principal dialects are Dzibi (Dzivi) and Dzonga. According to some estimates, there are just over one million BaTswa, but not all can speak the Tswa language. Many Mozambicans, including census officials, often consider it a dialect of Tsonga.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1891 Matthew-Luke Acts ABS, NewYork Translated by B. P.
