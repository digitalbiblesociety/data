This Latin version of the Holy Bible is primarily the work of St. Jerome (Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus), commissioned in 382 A.D. by Pope Damasus I to revise the old Latin translations. By the 13th century, this revision was known as the versio vulgata, meaning \"commonly used translation.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time, the Vulgate became the definitive and officially promulgated Latin version of the Holy Bible within the Catholic Church. The significance of this manuscript, particularly in its illuminated 1401 edition, lies not just in its religious importance but also in its influence on the development of Western Christianity, liturgy, and culture. The Vulgate's translation played a pivotal role in shaping the theological understanding and scriptural studies in the Latin-speaking Christian world, marking a significant epoch in the history of Christian texts.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"270","iso":"lat","year":1401,"type":"illuminated","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LATVSB_DBS_HS/Latin-(1401)-Biblia-Vulgate-Latin-(Illuminated)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
