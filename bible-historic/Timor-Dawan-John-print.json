The island is divided between the sovereign states of East Timor on the eastern part and Indonesia on the western part. The Indonesian part, also known as West Timor, constitutes part of the province of East Nusa Tenggara. Within West Timor lies an exclave of East Timor called Oecusse District. The island covers an area of 30,777 square kilometers (11,883 square miles). The name is a variant of Timur, Malay for \"east\"; it is so called because it lies at the eastern end of the Lesser Sunda Islands.
