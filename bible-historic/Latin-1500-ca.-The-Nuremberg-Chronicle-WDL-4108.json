The Nuremberg Chronicle (WDL-4108)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Liber chronicarum, also known as the Nuremberg Chronicle, is a universal history compiled by Hartmann Schedel (1440–1514), a Nuremberg doctor, humanist, and bibliophile. It stands as one of the most heavily illustrated and technically sophisticated early printed works, featuring 1809 woodcuts from 645 blocks. The production was financed by Nuremberg entrepreneur Sebald Schreyer and his brother-in-law, Sebastian Kammermeister. Artists Michael Wolgemut and Wilhelm Pleydenwurff, along with a young Albrecht Dürer during his apprenticeship, executed the illustrations around 1490, depicting both authentic and fictional or borrowed town views of artistic and topographical significance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis particularly vibrant copy, owned by Schedel, includes additional content like Erhard Etzlaub's map of the road to Rome. Following Schedel's ownership, the book became part of Johann Jacob Fugger's library and was acquired by Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria in 1571. The Nuremberg Chronicle is not only a historical document but also an invaluable source of information on medieval urban landscapes and early book illustration techniques.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/4108","filesize":"102","iso":"lat","year":1500,"type":"scan","provider":"Anton Koberger for Sebald Schreyer and Sebastian Kammermeister","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATNURE_DBS_HS/Latin-(1500-ca.)-The-Nuremberg-Chronicle-(WDL-4108)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
