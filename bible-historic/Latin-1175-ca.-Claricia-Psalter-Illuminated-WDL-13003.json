Claricia Psalter - Illuminated (WDL-13003)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Claricia Psalter, originating from the late 12th or early 13th century, was produced for and likely by Benedictine nuns at the Saints Ulrich and Afra Abbey in Augsburg, Germany. This psalter, inclusive of a calendar, was later supplemented in the mid-13th century with additional texts and prayers. Its illuminations are particularly noteworthy, featuring a prefatory cycle, full-page miniatures, and historiated initials, all rendered in Romanesque style but varying significantly in quality and technique. The artwork appears to be the collective effort of three or four different artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe psalter is named after a unique initial, which shows a young girl in secular clothing hanging from the letter \"Q.\" The name \"Claricia\" is inscribed around her head. There is speculation that this figure represents a novice artist who may have contributed to the manuscript, marking her work with this signature, although this theory remains one of many unconfirmed hypotheses. The Claricia Psalter stands out not only for its artistic diversity but also as a rare example of medieval nuns' engagement with manuscript illumination.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13003","filesize":"50","iso":"lat","year":1175,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATCLAR_DBS_HS/Latin-(1175-ca.)-Claricia-Psalter-Illuminated-(WDL-13003)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
