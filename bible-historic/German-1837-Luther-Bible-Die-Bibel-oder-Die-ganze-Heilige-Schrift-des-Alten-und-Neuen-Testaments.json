Luther's translation was groundbreaking as it was primarily from the original Hebrew and Greek texts, rather than the Latin Vulgate. This approach made the Scriptures more accessible to the general populace and laid the foundation for the Protestant Reformation in Germany. Luther's work also had a profound influence on the German language, comparable to the impact of the King James Version on English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Luther Bible has undergone several revisions to keep it relevant. The 1984 revision updated the text to modern German orthography, and in 1999, further changes were made, such as updating \"Weib\" to \"Frau\". Despite these updates, the language retains an archaic quality, making it challenging for non-native German speakers. The 2017 revision saw the reversion of some passages back to Luther's original, stronger phrasing. The Luther Bible not only remains central to German Protestantism but also continues to influence the German language and culture.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"135","iso":"deu","year":1837,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"DEUL45_DBS_HS/German-(1837)-Luther-Bible-Die-Bibel-oder-Die-ganze-Heilige-Schrift-des-Alten-und-Neuen-Testaments","language":{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","level":"L","location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"DE","latitude":48.648954,"longitude":12.467623,"population":76100000,"status_id":"1"}}
