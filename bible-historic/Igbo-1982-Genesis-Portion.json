The core Igbo cluster or Igbo proper is generally thought to be one language but there is limited mutual intelligibility between the different groupings (north, west, south and east). A standard literary language termed 'Igbo izugbe' (meaning \"general igbo\") was generically developed and later adopted around 1972, with its core foundation based on the Owerri (Isuama), Anambra (Awka) and Umuahia (Ohuhu) dialects, omitting the nasalization and aspiration of those varieties. However, nobody speaks \"general Igbo\" natively and it isn't accepted by all Igbo groups. The largest variety of the core Igbo cluster is Ngwa.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"281","iso":"ibo","year":1982,"type":"genesis","provider":"The British and Foreign Bible Society","org_id":"british-and-foreign-bible-society","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"IBOILB_DBS_HS/Igbo-(1982)-Genesis-Portion","language":{"iso":"ibo","glotto_id":"afik1238","iso1":"ig","name":"Igbo","autonym":"Asụsụ Igbo","level":"L","location":"Nigeria, Map 6","area":"Abia state, Anambra state, Aguata, Anambra, Awka, Idemili, Ihiala, Njikoka, Nnewi, and Onitsha LGAs; Enugu state, Awgu, Enugu, Ezeagu, Igo-Etiti, Igbo-Eze, Isi-Uzo, Nkanu, Nsukka, Udi, and Uzo-Uwani LGAs; Imo state; Rivers state, Ikwerre, Bonny, and Ahoada LGAs; Delta state, Oshimili, Aniocha, and Ndokwa LGAs; Akwa Ibom state, Ika LGA.
