Echternach Gospel Lectionary - Illuminated (WDL-14704)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Echternach Gospel Lectionary, an early 11th-century manuscript, exemplifies the late Ottonian tradition in book illumination. It features 292 golden majuscule initials, 30 gold initials, five decorated text pages, a full-page initial, and a miniature of Christ in Majesty. Notably, the 16-line introductory poem on folio 1 verso is inscribed in gold rustic capitals on a purple background. The facing page showcases Christ in Majesty, seated within a mandorla and making the sign of blessing, flanked by the Evangelists' symbols in the frame's corners. Although many assume the manuscript originated from the Echternach Abbey (current-day Luxembourg), its provenance is still a topic of debate among scholars. After private ownership, it was acquired in the 18th century by Provost Franziscus Töpsl for Polling Abbey and subsequently moved to the Munich court library in 1803. This lectionary is a significant piece, showcasing the artistic and religious nuances of the Ottonian era in manuscript illumination.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/14704","filesize":"57","iso":"lat","year":1000,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Salvatoris Pollingae","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATECHT_DBS_HS/Latin-(1000-ca.)-Echternach-Gospel-Lectionary-Illuminated-(WDL-14704)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
