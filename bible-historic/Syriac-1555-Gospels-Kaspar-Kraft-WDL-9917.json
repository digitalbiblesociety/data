Key contributors to this edition included Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter, a pivotal figure in the study of Eastern languages in Europe, and Moses of Mardin, whose handwriting influenced the Syriac typeface created for this publication by Kaspar Kraft under the guidance of French Orientalist Guillaume Postel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis edition is distinguished by its content, including the books of James, 1 Peter, and 1 John, but notably excluding the other General Epistles and the Book of Revelation. The book is also remarkable for its artistic elements, featuring woodcuts with Hapsburg motifs, Syriac and Latin inscriptions, and a unique illustration of the crucifixion paired with the Kabbalistic Sephirot at the beginning of the Gospel of John. These artistic additions highlight the cultural and religious significance of the work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDesigned for liturgical use, this edition concludes with a Syriac and Latin table of lectionary readings, underscoring its practical application in Christian worship. The 1555 Syriac New Testament thus stands as a key artifact in the history of biblical scholarship, showcasing a fusion of religious, linguistic, and cultural elements of its time.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/9917","filesize":"289","iso":"syr","year":1555,"type":"scan","provider":"Michael Zimmermann","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"SYRGOSP_DBS_HS/Syriac-(1555)-Gospels-Kaspar-Kraft-(WDL-9917)","language":{"iso":"syr","glotto_id":"syr","name":"Syriac","level":"L","country_id":"IQ","population":858080}}
