{"id":"Latvian-John-print","abbr":"LAVLVR","title":"Latvian - John (Print)","title_vernacular":"Latviešu Jāņa Evaņģēlijs","description":"Latvian, also known as Lettish, is an Eastern Baltic language belonging to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European language family, spoken in the Baltic region. It is the language of Latvians and the official language of Latvia as well as one of the official languages of the European Union. There are about 1.3 million native Latvian speakers in Latvia and 100,000 abroad. Altogether, 2 million, or 80% of the population of Latvia, speak Latvian. Of those, around 1.16 million or 62% of Latvia's population use it as their primary language at home, however excluding the Latgale Region it is spoken as a native language in villages and towns by over 90% of the population.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Baltic language, Latvian is most closely related to neighboring Lithuanian (as well as Old Prussian, an extinct Baltic language); however Latvian has followed a more rapid development. In addition, there is some disagreement about whether Latgalian and Kursenieki, which are mutually intelligible with Latvian, should be considered varieties or separate languages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLatvian first appeared in print in the mid-16th century with the reproduction of the Lord's Prayer in Latvian in Sebastian Münster's Cosmographia Universalis (1544), in Latin script.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"229","iso":"lav","year":1953,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LAVLVR_DBS_HS/Latvian-John-(print)","language":{"iso":"lav","glotto_id":"latv1249","iso1":"lv","name":"Latvian","autonym":"latviešu","level":"L","location":"Latvia","country_id":"LV","latitude":56.826108,"longitude":24.309118,"population":1728760}}
