Rivington. Born in 1802, Williams was not only a devoted student but also a disciple of John Keble, a prominent leader in the Oxford Movement. This movement, deeply rooted in the University of Oxford, sought to revive the rich traditions and sacramental life of the Church of England. Williams' contribution to this movement included both poetry and prose, with one of his most notable works being the tract titled \"On Reserve in Communicating Religious Knowledge.\" His \"Harmony of the Four Evangelists\" is a testament to his theological depth and commitment to integrating the narratives of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John into a cohesive and harmonized account of the Gospel. This work reflects Williams' scholarly approach to Biblical texts and his commitment to the high-church tradition of the Anglican faith. It remains a significant piece in the study of the Gospels, offering insights into the interconnectedness of the Evangelists' accounts.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"99","iso":"eng","year":1850,"type":"study","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGWIL_DBS_HS/English-(1850)-Williams-Gospels-(Harmony-of-the-Evangelists)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
