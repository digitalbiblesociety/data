Ottobeuren Gospel - Illuminated (WDL-13472)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Ottobeuren Gospel book, dating to around 1165, is renowned for its decorated canon tables across 16 pages and the portraits of the evangelists at the beginning of their respective Gospels. It features five full-page framed miniatures on gilt ground, including a depiction of Christ enthroned, holding a book and blessing with his right hand. Eight pen-drawn initials mark the beginnings of the argumenta (short versions of the evangelist’s life) in the Gospels of Mark, Luke, and John, as well as passages in all four Gospels concerning the Passion of Christ. The first prologue and each Gospel commence with an initial painted in gold. This Gospel is attributed to a group of lavishly illuminated liturgical manuscripts created during Abbot Isingrim of Ottobeuren's tenure (1145−80) at the Ottobeuren Abbey in Bavaria. These valuable codices are now dispersed across various libraries and private collections. Due to its style, scholars date this particular liturgical book to around 1165, highlighting its significance in the study of medieval manuscript illumination and religious art.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13472","filesize":"44","iso":"lat","year":1165,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATOTTO_DBS_HS/Latin-(1165-ca.)-Ottobeuren-Gospel-Illuminated-(WDL-13472)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
