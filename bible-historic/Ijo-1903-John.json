The Ijo language cluster includes the languages of the Eastern Ijo, namely Kalabari, Okrika, and Ibani; the Brass Ijo, including Nembe and Akassa; Izon, including Bumo, Kolokuma, Mein, and Arogbo; Biseni; Okodia; Oruma; and Nkoroo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDaniel Ockiya, son of the African king of Brass, and a youthful convert, who was educated at a mission school, spent 54 years translating and revising the Ijo Scriptures.
