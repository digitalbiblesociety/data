He is particularly famous for his lectures between 1741 and 1750, in which he reimagined the Hebrew Bible as literature, focusing on its artistic and formal qualities. Lowth's major contribution was the rediscovery of parallelism in ancient Hebrew poetry, which he theorized originated from the responsive singing of the seraphim. At a time when the divine authority of the Bible was declining, Lowth's work on classifying large portions of prophecy as poetry helped elevate the human figure of the prophet as a literary genius. He portrayed the prophetic-poetic text as \"strong,\" characterized by artfulness, control, order, and balance. His work responded to contemporary concerns about the Bible and biblical prophecy in eighteenth-century English society, simultaneously introducing more passion, enthusiasm, and subjectivity into neoclassical English poetry. Despite his efforts to minimize the irregularities and complexities in prophecy, Lowth's scholarship inadvertently transmitted these elements into English literature, influencing Romantic poets like William Blake to adopt similar complex prophetic stances in their work.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"221","iso":"eng","year":1836,"type":"scan","provider":"Robert Lowth, D.D., F.R.S., Bishop of London","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGLOW_DBS_HS/English-(1836)-The-Prophets-(Lowth)-Bible-Vol.1-5-OT-Prophets","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
