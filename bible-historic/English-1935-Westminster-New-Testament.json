{"id":"English-1935-Westminster-New-Testament","abbr":"ENGWEST","title":"English (1935) Westminster New Testament","title_vernacular":"","description":"The Westminster New Testament, a distinguished Roman Catholic translation in England, emerged as a notable scholarly endeavor, initiated in 1913 and culminating with the completion of the New Testament in 1936. Spearheaded by General Editors Cuthbert Lattey (1877-1954) and Joseph Keating (1865-1939), the project demonstrated meticulous translation efforts, releasing parts of each volume as separate fascicles. This approach underscored the comprehensive and detailed nature of the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMarked by its adherence to Roman Catholic teachings, the Westminster New Testament offers a unique lens within the realm of biblical translations. Post the New Testament's completion, the team embarked on translating the Old Testament, with portions appearing in the 1940s and 50s. However, following Lattey's passing in 1954, the Old Testament translation ceased. Ultimately, a complete Bible was published in 1958 and reissued in 1966, combining the Westminster New Testament and Psalms with the Old Testament from Challoner's revision of the Douay-Rheims Version. This edition not only stands as a scholarly contribution but also bridges traditional Roman Catholic doctrine with contemporary biblical interpretations.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"11","iso":"eng","year":1935,"type":"scan","provider":"Longmans, Green and Co.","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGWEST_DBS_HS/English-(1935)-Westminster-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
