{"id":"English-1905-Samuel-Loyd-Corrected-English-New-Testament","abbr":"ENGLOYD","title":"English (1905) Samuel Loyd Corrected English New Testament","title_vernacular":"","description":"The 1905 \"Corrected English New Testament,\" edited by Samuel Lloyd, stands as a unique contribution to the field of biblical translation. As a wealthy Quaker and a life governor of the British and Foreign Bible Society, Lloyd embarked on this revision project without formal academic credentials, yet with a dedication to scholarly rigor. His work was not officially sponsored by the British and Foreign Bible Society, a fact contrary to what the title might suggest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLloyd's revision relied on Nestle's resultant text, reflecting the evolving biblical scholarship of the time. He collaborated with eminent scholars to ensure accuracy and scholarly depth. The preface by the Bishop of Durham added ecclesiastical weight to the work. Published in London by Samuel Bagster in 1905, this version was part of Lloyd's effort to commemorate the centenary of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1904. This venture highlights the significant role individuals outside traditional academic and religious circles can play in the dynamic world of biblical interpretation and translation.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"84","iso":"eng","year":1905,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGLOYD_DBS_HS/English-(1905)-Samuel-Loyd-Corrected-English-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
