Ellenhard Canons of the Gospels - Illuminated (WDL-14702)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginating from the 11th century in Freising, Bavaria, the Ellenhard Canons of the Gospels is a Gospel book presented by Bishop Ellenhard (1052 or 1053−78) to the Saint Andreas collegiate church in Freising. The manuscript was initially richly adorned with 11 initials, 14 canon tables, four Evangelist portraits, and a full-page dedication miniature, which was later moved to a Gospel lectionary (also in the Bavarian State Library, shelf mark Clm 6831). The transferred miniature portrays Bishop Ellenhard before Saint Andreas, the patron saint, who is shown offering the book to Christ. The book's front cover features a framed Byzantine ivory. Additionally, the manuscript includes the preface to the four Gospels by Saint Jerome (died 419 or 420) and letters by Jerome and Eusebius of Caesarea (circa 260−circa 340). Following the dissolution of the Saint Andreas collegiate church in Freising in 1803, the manuscript was transferred to Munich. This Gospel book is a valuable piece of medieval religious and artistic heritage, reflecting the rich tradition of manuscript illumination and religious patronage of the period.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/14702","filesize":"68","iso":"lat","year":1000,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATELLE_DBS_HS/Latin-(1000-ca.)-Ellenhard-Canons-of-the-Gospels-Illuminated-(WDL-14702)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
