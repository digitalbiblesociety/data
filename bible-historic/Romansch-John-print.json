{"id":"Romansch-John-print","abbr":"ROHPOR","title":"Romansch - John (Print)","title_vernacular":"Rumantsch - Gion","description":"Romans sometimes also spelled Romansch and Rumantsch is a Gallo-Romance language spoken predominantly in the Swiss canton of the Grisons (Graub√ºnden). Romansh has been recognized as a national language of Switzerland since 1938, and as an official language in correspondence with Romansh-speaking citizens since 1996, along with German, French, and Italian. It also has official status in the canton of the Grisons alongside German and Italian and is used as the medium of instruction in schools in Romansh-speaking areas. It is sometimes grouped by linguists with Ladin and Friulian as the Rhaeto-Romance languages, though this is disputed. Romansch is spoken in all by less than 50,000 people, some in southern Switzerland (where it has been the fourth official language since 1938), and more in adjacent Italy. Also known as Ladin, or Grisons, it is spoken in several dialects and is thought by some to be a direct survival of the vulgar Latin used in Roman military settlements of the southern Alpine region.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRomansch comprises the western tongue of the Rhaeto-Romance languages, a group which also includes as many as a million speakers of related Tyrolian and Frioulan dialects. Lower Engadine Romansch is the dialect of the Eastern, or Lower, Engadine Valley, the valley of the Inn River, in the Grisons Canton, southeastern Switzerland.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1562 Psalms J.
