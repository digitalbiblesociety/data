The translation of this pivotal New Testament book into Albanian was part of a broader movement to make religious texts accessible to non-English speakers worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Gospel of Luke, known for its detailed narrative of Jesus Christ's life and teachings, holds special significance in Christian theology. Translating it into Albanian not only served to spread Christian doctrines but also contributed to the linguistic and cultural enrichment of the Albanian language. This translation project, undertaken by the Massachusetts Bible Society, reflects their commitment to religious education and the promotion of cultural diversity within Christian teachings. The introduction of this translated text in Albania, a region with a rich yet complex religious history, played a crucial role in shaping the religious understanding and practices of its people. This 1910 translation, by bringing the Gospel of Luke to Albanian readers in their native language, helped bridge the gap between religious teachings and cultural identity, fostering a deeper, more personal connection to the biblical narrative.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"4","iso":"sqi","year":1910,"type":"scan","provider":"Treg Nerkomgetare","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"SQIALB_DBS_HS/Albanian-(1910)-Luke","language":{"iso":"sqi","glotto_id":"sqi","iso1":"sq","name":"Albanian","autonym":"shqip","level":"L","country_id":"AL","population":5878700}}
