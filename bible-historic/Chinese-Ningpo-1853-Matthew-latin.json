{"id":"Chinese-Ningpo-1853-Matthew-latin","abbr":"WUURNT","title":"Chinese Ningpo (1853) Matthew (latin)","title_vernacular":"馬太福音 (1853, 拉丁)","description":"The 1853 translation of the Gospel of Matthew into the Ningpo dialect marks a significant milestone in the history of biblical translations in China. Ningpo, a variant of the Wu language spoken in the Ningbo area of northeastern Zhejiang Province, was selected for its regional importance. This translation effort was part of a larger initiative to make the Scriptures accessible to Chinese speakers in their native dialects, spearheaded by missionaries including William A. Russell (Church Missionary Society), Divie B. McCartee, William A. P. Martin, and Henry V. N. Rankin from the American Presbyterian Mission. These missionaries' collaborative work led to the translation of key New Testament books by 1861 and parts of the Old Testament by 1860, starting with Genesis and reaching Exodus 20. The work significantly contributed to the spread of Christianity in the region and the development of Ningpo dialect literature. The American Bible Society in Shanghai published a revision of Genesis and Exodus in 1871, reflecting ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and readability of these translations for local believers and readers.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"11","iso":"wuu","year":1853,"type":"scan","provider":" Nyng-po","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"WUURNT_DBS_HS/Chinese-Ningpo-(1853)-Matthew-(latin)","language":{"iso":"wuu","glotto_id":"wuch1236","name":"Wu Chinese","autonym":"吳語/吴语","level":"L","location":"China","area":"Jiangsu south of Changjiang River, east of Zhenjiang, on Chongming Island, mouth of the Changjiang, and north of the Changjiang in the area around Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Qingjiang; Zhejiang Province south to Quzhou, Jinhua, and Wenzhou.
