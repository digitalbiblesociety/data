The eschatological content of the Apocalypse made it one of the most popular books among the Russian Old Believers. A version of the Apocalypse with commentary, probably written in the late-sixth century by the Eastern Christian theologian Andrew, Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, was the most widely read text among the Old Believers. Other versions with commentary by other theologians supplementing that of Andrew of Caesarea also were in circulation. Quite often these annotated manuscripts of the Apocalypse were illustrated with colorful miniatures. Presented here is a splendid example of this type of Apocalypse—an 18th-century manuscript from the collections of the Institute of History of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (II SO RAN) in Novosibirsk, Russia. It was acquired during the institute’s archeographic expedition to Tomsk Oblast in 1972 and digitized in the early 2000s as part of the Meeting of Frontiers project of the Library of Congress and partner institutions in the Russian Federation, the United States, and Germany.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/17063","filesize":"70","iso":"chu","year":1700,"type":"scan","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"CHU1700_DBS_HS/Old-Church-Slavonic-(1700-ca.)-Revalation-Tomsk-Oblast-(WDL-17063)","language":{"iso":"chu","glotto_id":"chur1257","iso1":"cu","name":"Church Slavic","autonym":"Old Church Slavic","level":"A","country_id":"RU","latitude":43.717123,"longitude":22.844237,"status_id":"10"}}
