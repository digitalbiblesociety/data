Though relatively isolated from them, it is related to the Mayan languages spoken further south and east in Mexico and Central America. According to the 2005 population census, there are about 200,000 speakers of Huasteco in Mexico (some 120,000 in San Luis Potosí and some 80,000 in Veracruz). The language and its speakers are also called Teenek, and this name has gained currency in Mexican national and international usage in recent years.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"3","iso":"hus","year":2005,"type":"book","provider":"La Liga Biblica","org_id":"bible-league-international","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HUSLLB_DBS_HS/Huasteco-Veracruz-(2005)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"hus","glotto_id":"huas1241","name":"Huastec","autonym":"Huasteco","level":"L","location":"Mexico","area":"Northern Veracruz. 60 villages.","country_id":"MX","latitude":21.6153,"longitude":-98.50276,"population":174000,"status_id":"4"}}
