As a codex, it stands out from traditional scroll forms of Hebrew manuscripts. This particular Bible is comprised of three volumes, collectively containing all 24 books of the Hebrew Bible. Volume One is dedicated to the Torah, or the Five Books of Moses, also known as the Pentateuch. The subsequent volumes cover the Prophets and the Hagiographa (Holy Writings), respectively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, this manuscript includes lists of the Commandments found in the Torah and Masoretic material, providing critical information on the correct spelling, reading, and pronunciation of the biblical text. This inclusion enhances its value as a resource for biblical study and understanding. The Lisbon Bible was acquired by the British Museum (now part of the British Library) in 1882. Its current binding, which was crafted in 1954, replaced the original 16th-century leather covers, signifying the manuscript's historical significance and the care taken to preserve it over the centuries.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"187","iso":"heb","year":1483,"type":"manuscript","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HEBLISB_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1483)-Lisbon-Bible-(Pentateuch)-Vol.-1-6-Manuscript","language":{"iso":"heb","glotto_id":"hebr1245","iso1":"he","name":"Hebrew","autonym":"Israeli Hebrew","level":"L","area":"Also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, Panama, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.10565,"longitude":35.01788,"population":5000000,"status_id":"1"}}
