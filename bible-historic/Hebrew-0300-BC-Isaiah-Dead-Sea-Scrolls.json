First uncovered by Bedouin shepherds in 1946 in Qumran Cave 1, this scroll is remarkable for containing the entire Book of Isaiah in Hebrew, with only a few small portions damaged. Its significance lies in its age; it is approximately 1000 years older than any previously known Hebrew manuscripts of the Book of Isaiah, dating back to around 300 BC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1QIsa holds the distinction of being the only scroll from the Qumran Caves to be almost entirely preserved. The manuscript is written on 17 sheets of parchment, making it notably large. It measures about 734 cm (24 feet) in length and varies from 25.3 to 27 cm (10 to 10.6 inches) in height, with the text spanning across 54 columns. The preservation of the Isaiah Scroll provides invaluable insights into the textual history of the Hebrew Bible and serves as a crucial resource for scholars studying the evolution of biblical texts and the religious practices of the period.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"26","iso":"hbo","year":70,"type":"manuscript","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HBODSS_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(0300-BC)-Isaiah-(Dead-Sea-Scrolls).zip","language":{"iso":"hbo","glotto_id":"anci1244","name":"Ancient Hebrew","autonym":"עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית","level":"H","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.77607,"longitude":35.17248,"status_id":"9"}}
