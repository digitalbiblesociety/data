As the first significant missionary from America to work overseas, Judson's translation of the entire Bible into Burmese was a monumental task that provided the foundation for the spread of Christianity among the Burmese people. His work not only made the Scriptures accessible to the Burmese-speaking population for the first time but also played a crucial role in establishing a number of Baptist churches across the country. This version of the Bible is a testament to Judson's dedication to his faith and his commitment to the people of Myanmar, offering them the opportunity to explore the Christian faith in their native language. Through his efforts, Judson left a lasting legacy that continues to influence the religious landscape of Myanmar today.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"184","iso":"mya","year":1840,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MYABJB_DBS_HS/Burmese-(1840)-Judson-Bible","language":{"iso":"mya","glotto_id":"nucl1310","iso1":"my","name":"Burmese","autonym":"Myanmar","level":"L","location":"Central Myanmar","area":"South, central, and adjacent areas.
