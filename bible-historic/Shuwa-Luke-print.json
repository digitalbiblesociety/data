The majority of its speakers live in southern Chad. Its range is an east-to-west oval in the Sahel. Nearly all of this territory is within Chad or Sudan. It is also spoken elsewhere in the vicinity of Lake Chad in the countries of Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger. Finally, it is spoken in slivers of the Central African Republic, and South Sudan. In addition, this language serves as a lingua franca in much of the region. In most of its range, it is one of several local languages and often not among the major ones.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"2","iso":"shu","year":2012,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"SHUATL_DBS_HS/Siau-New-Testament-(book)","language":{"iso":"shu","glotto_id":"chad1249","name":"Chadian Arabic","autonym":"Shuwa","level":"L","location":"Northern Cameroon","area":"Salamat, Ouaddaï, Wadi Fira regions, Batha region center and west, much of Chari-Baguirmi; Mayo-Kebbi; north Tandjilé; Guéra.
