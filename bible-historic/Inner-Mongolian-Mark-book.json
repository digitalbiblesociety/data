{"id":"Inner-Mongolian-Mark-book","abbr":"MVFARI","title":"Inner Mongolian - Mark (Book)","title_vernacular":"Inner Mongolian - ᠮᠠᠷᠠᠭ (ᠪᠣᠯᠠᠭ)","description":"Mongols in Inner Mongolia speak Mongolian dialects such as Chakhar, Xilingol, Baarin, Khorchin and Kharchin Mongolian and, depending on definition and analysis, further dialects or closely related independent Central Mongolic languages such as Ordos, Khamnigan, Barghu Buryat and the arguably Oirat dialect Alasha. The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the Plain Blue Banner, located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all Southern Mongolian dialects. This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related Khalkha dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in Hulunbuir such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language Dagur and the Tungusic language Evenki. Officially, even the Evenki dialect Oroqin is considered a language.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"6","iso":"mvf","year":2004,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MVFARI_DBS_HS/Inner-Mongolian-Mark-(book)","language":{"iso":"mvf","glotto_id":"peri1253","name":"Peripheral Mongolian","autonym":"Inner Mongolian","level":"L","location":"China","area":"Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, Urumchi to Hailar.
