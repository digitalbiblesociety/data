{"id":"German-1522-September-Illuminated-Luther-NT","abr":"DEUL45","tt":"German (1522)  Illuminated September Luther New Testament","description":"German (1522) Illuminated September Luther New Testament Martin Luther's translation of the Bible, known as the September Bible, was a pivotal work in Germany's religious, linguistic, and social history. First published in its entirety in 1534, Luther’s translation from Greek was more accurate than earlier translations from the Vulgate. This work played a crucial role in unifying the German language by transcending its diverse dialects. A notable codex of this Bible is housed in the library of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland. This version is embellished with full-page woodcuts by Lucas Cranach and was owned by Johann Gramann, known as the “Apostle of Prussia”, a contemporary and supporter of Luther. The margins of the pages in this particular copy are filled with notes by Gramann, many derived from his discussions with Luther himself. This Bible not only reflects the theological shifts of the Reformation but also represents a significant development in the German language and print culture, facilitated by Gutenberg's invention of the printing press.","description_vernacular":"German-1522-September-Illuminated-Luther-NT.jpg","ref":"","iso":"deu","dt":1522,"tp":"illuminated","pro":"","dg":"","aid":"DEUL45_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","level":"L","location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"DE","latitude":48.648954,"longitude":12.467623,"population":76100000,"status_id":"1","bibles":null,"films":null,"resources":null}}
