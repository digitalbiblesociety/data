Originally spoken in Spain, and then after the Edict of Expulsion spreading through the Ottoman Empire (the Balkans, Turkey, Western Asia, and North Africa) as well as France, Italy, the Netherlands, Morocco, and England, it is today spoken mainly by Sephardic minorities in more than 30 countries, with most speakers residing in Israel. Although it has no official status in any country, it has been acknowledged as a minority language in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel, France, and Turkey. In 2017, it was formally recognised by the Royal Spanish Academy.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"7","iso":"lad","year":1951,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LADPOR_DBS_HS/Ladino-Mark-(print)","language":{"iso":"lad","glotto_id":"ladi1251","name":"Ladino","autonym":"Ladino","level":"L","area":"Ethnic group members also in Salonica, Greece; Sofia, Bulgaria.
