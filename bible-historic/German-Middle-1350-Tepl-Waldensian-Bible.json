{"id":"German-Middle-1350-Tepl-Waldensian-Bible","abbr":"GML1350","title":"German Middle (1350) Tepl Waldensian Bible","title_vernacular":"Tepler Waldenserbibel (1350)","description":"The Tepl Waldensian Bible, dating back to around 1350, represents a significant artifact from the pre-Reformation period, belonging to the Waldensians. This group, originating in the late 12th century as the \"Poor Men of Lyon,\" advocated apostolic poverty and independence from episcopal authority, leading to their condemnation as heretical by the Catholic Church in 1215. Despite intense persecution and discrimination, the Waldensians persisted, eventually aligning with the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, notably through the Resolutions of Chanforan in 1532 which formally integrated them into the Calvinist tradition. This Bible is a testament to the Waldensians' enduring commitment to scriptural access and understanding, predating mainstream Protestant movements. Their legacy continues through the Union of Methodist and Waldensian Churches in Italy and other congregations worldwide, emphasizing social justice, religious diversity, and freedom of conscience.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"280","iso":"gml","year":1350,"type":"manuscript","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GML1350_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"gml","glotto_id":"midd1318","name":"Middle Low German","level":"H","country_id":"DE"}}
