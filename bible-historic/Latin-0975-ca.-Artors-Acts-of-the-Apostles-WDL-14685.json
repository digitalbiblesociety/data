Artors Acts of the Apostles (WDL-14685)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArator's \"De Actibus Apostolorum\" (Acts of the Apostles), originating in the 6th century, stands as the final Roman Biblical verse epic in the classical tradition. This 10th-century manuscript is embellished with a pen-and-ink drawing, showcasing Arator presenting his work to Florianus, abbot of a convent near Milan, marking the oldest surviving portrait of Arator. The manuscript, extensively utilized in the Middle Ages, is believed to have been authored and adorned in southwest Germany around the late 10th century. It represents one of the few illuminated manuscripts from the Strasburg-Speyer-Worms region. Shortly after its completion, the codex is thought to have been transferred to the Benedictine monastery of Tegernsee, as indicated by additions from 11th-century scribes from this monastery, including Froumund. This manuscript holds significance for its artistic and historical value, reflecting both the literary and monastic traditions of the period.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/14685","filesize":"37","iso":"lat","year":975,"type":"scan","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LATARTO_DBS_HS/Latin-(0975-ca.)-Artors-Acts-of-the-Apostles-(WDL-14685)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latÄ«na","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
