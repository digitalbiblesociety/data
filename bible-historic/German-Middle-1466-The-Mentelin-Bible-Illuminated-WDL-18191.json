This edition, like Gutenberg's, does not specify its printer or printing date. However, type analysis and a handwritten note detailing its purchase on 27 June 1466 by Hektor Mülich, an Augsburg merchant, confirm its production timeframe. Mülich's acquisition of the Bible unbound, followed by personal arrangements for its binding and rubrication, illustrates the custom practices of book personalization post-purchase and highlights the existence of a supra-regional book market in the 1460s.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe document also suggests that the Mentelin Bible, richly decorated by Mülich, played a significant role in the personal library of a prominent Augsburg figure, emphasizing German-language literature over early humanism. The resolution of its status as the first printed German Bible came in 1787 by Munich court librarian Gerhoh Steigenberger, who determined that Heinrich Eggestein's undated Strasbourg edition was an almost identical reprint of Mentelin's work, thereby confirming the Mentelin Bible's precedence in printing history.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8924","filesize":"511","iso":"gmh","year":1466,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Johann Mentelin, Strasbourg","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"GMHMENT_DBS_HS/German-Middle-(1466)-The-Mentelin-Bible-Illuminated-(WDL-18191)","language":{"iso":"gmh","glotto_id":"midd1343","name":"Middle High German (ca. 1050-1500)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
