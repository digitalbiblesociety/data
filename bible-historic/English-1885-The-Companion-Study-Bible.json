{"id":"English-1885-The-Companion-Study-Bible","abbr":"ENGKJV","title":"English (1885) The Companion Study Bible (Study)","title_vernacular":"","description":"\"The Companion Study Bible\" stands as a testament to America's rich history of Bible printing, which evolved significantly from its limited beginnings in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. During this early period, most Bibles were supplied by European printers or brought by immigrants, a testament to the cultural and technological constraints of the time. However, as advancements in printing techniques and machinery merged with increasing demand, a notable shift occurred by the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This era marked a significant surge in Bible publishing, with cities like Boston, Philadelphia, and New York emerging as primary publishing centers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBible historian Paul Gutjahr's insights reveal the Bible's immense popularity in eighteenth-century North America, dubbing it the “most printed, most distributed, and most read written text.” This popularity extended beyond its religious significance, as the Bible also symbolized familial heritage and cultural pride. It connected families to their ancestral past and served as a cherished possession. Recognizing this profound connection, publishers began producing Bibles with ornate features, such as elaborately carved or embossed covers and intricate illustrations. These aesthetic enhancements transformed the Bible into a symbol of both spiritual and cultural value, often displayed prominently in homes. \"The Companion Study Bible\" fits within this historical narrative, reflecting the evolution of Bible printing in America and its deep-seated importance in both the religious and domestic realms.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"111","iso":"eng","year":1885,"type":"study","provider":"Humphrey Milford, University Press","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGKJV_DBS_HS/English-(1885)-The-Companion-Study-Bible","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
