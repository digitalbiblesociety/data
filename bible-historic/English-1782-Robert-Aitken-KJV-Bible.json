{"id":"English-1782-Robert-Aitken-KJV-Bible","abbr":"ENGKJV","title":"English (1782) Robert Aitken KJV Bible","title_vernacular":"","description":"The 1782 Robert Aitken KJV Bible holds a special place in American history as the first complete English Bible printed in the United States. This milestone was achieved in the aftermath of the War of Independence, a time when there was a notable shortage of Bibles in America. Published by Robert Aitken and printed in Philadelphia, this edition of the King James translation was unique in that it carried an American imprint. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrior to American independence, Great Britain had prohibited the American colonies from printing copies of the Bible. However, the newfound independence allowed for the publication of Bibles in America. The Aitken Bible was not only printed locally but also received approval and recommendation from the chaplains of the United States Congress, both the Senate and the House. This Bible is noted for its translation from the original Greek and its comparison with other English translations. An interesting aspect of the Aitken Bible is that the text of the New Testament is not paginated in the traditional sense; it flows continuously from book to book. Additionally, there are a few textual errors within this edition. Despite these minor issues, the Robert Aitken KJV Bible remains a significant historical artifact, symbolizing both American independence and the growing importance of religious freedom in the new nation.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"245","iso":"eng","year":1782,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGKJV_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
