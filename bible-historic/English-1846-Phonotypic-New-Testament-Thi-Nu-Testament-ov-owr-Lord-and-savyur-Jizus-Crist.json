His phonetic alphabet was designed to assist his students, especially those with speech impediments, in improving their speech. Comstock’s version of the New Testament was translated from the original Greek and compared with other translations for accuracy and revision. He believed his phonetic alphabet was superior among the seven known phonetic systems at that time. Comstock's aim with this translation extended beyond speech improvement; he also hoped it would facilitate evangelism among non-native English speakers, including \"the heathen.\" A rare first edition, as noted by Dr. Paul Keen, it includes a table within the text explaining the phonetic characters and the sounds they represent.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"36","iso":"eng","year":1846,"type":"scan","provider":"Zac Pitmun","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGPHO_DBS_HS/English-(1846)-Phonotypic-New-Testament-(Thi-Nu-Testament-ov-owr-Lord-and-savyur-Jizus-Crist)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
