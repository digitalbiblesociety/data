However, in a 1963 report on a survey of Fujian, Pan Maoding and colleagues argued that the primary split was between inland and coastal groups. In a reclassification that has been followed by most dialectologists since, they restricted the term Northern Min to inland dialects of Nanping prefecture, and classified the coastal dialects of Fuzhou and Ningde as Eastern Min.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the Language Atlas of China, Northern Min varieties are spoken throughout the counties of Wuyishan (formerly Chong'an), Jianyang, Jian'ou, Zhenghe, and Songxi, in the southern part of Pucheng County and the northeastern part of Shunchang County, and in Yanping District except for the Nanping dialect of the urban area of Nanping, which is an island of an isolated Mandarin dialect of uncertain affinity. The Jianyang and Jian'ou dialects are often taken as representative.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"341","iso":"mnp","year":1896,"type":"scan","provider":"The British and Foreign Bible Society","org_id":"british-and-foreign-bible-society","digitizer":"Google","archive_id":"MNPMHB_DBS_HS/Min-Bei-Chinese-Kienning-(1896)-New-Testament-(Seng-io-cuing-su)-Northern-Min-(latin)","language":{"iso":"mnp","glotto_id":"minb1244","name":"Min Bei Chinese","autonym":"Min Bei","level":"L","location":"Southern China","area":"North Fujian Province, 7 counties around Jian’ou.
