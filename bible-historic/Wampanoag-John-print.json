{"id":"Wampanoag-John-print","abbr":"WAMPJN","title":"Wampanoag - John (Print)","title_vernacular":"","description":"Wampanoag language, historically represented several divergent forms, mainly due to the insular regions. The Wampanoag inhabited most of southeastern Massachusetts, with more isolated, and likely divergent, communities found on Cape Cod, the Elizabeth Islands, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket. In addition, Wampanoag inhabited much of what is now south-eastern Rhode Island. The name of the people refers to the 'east' or 'dawn,' from Massachusett wompan- (wôpan-) /wãpan/. In terms of contemporary speakers of the Massachusett language, all of them are speakers of the revived Wampanoag dialect of the Wôpanâak Language Reclamation Project and come from the Aquinnah, Assonet, Herring Pond, and Mashpee tribes. Historically, the Wampanoag were also known as the Pokanoket, which was actually the name of a confederacy that included most of the Wampanoag tribes.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"252","iso":"wam","year":1709,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"WAMPJN_DBS_HS/Wampanoag-John-(print)","language":{"iso":"wam","glotto_id":"wamp1249","name":"Wampanoag","autonym":"Massachusett unnontꝏwaonk","level":"E","area":"Southeast Massachusetts.","country_id":"US","latitude":41.70504,"longitude":-73.31478,"status_id":"9"}}
