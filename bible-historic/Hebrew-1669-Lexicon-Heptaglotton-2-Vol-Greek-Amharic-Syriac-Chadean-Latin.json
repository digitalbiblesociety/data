This lexicon, spanning two volumes, offers a comprehensive linguistic resource for seven languages: Hebrew, Chaldean, Syriac, Samaritan, Ethiopian, Arabic, and Persian. Each language is addressed separately, enriching its scholarly value.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCastello's ambitious project was significant for compiling an extensive array of lexical entries in these languages, each with deep historical and religious roots. The inclusion of less commonly studied languages like Samaritan and Ethiopian, alongside Hebrew and Arabic, highlights the 17th-century scholarly interest in linguistic diversity. This lexicon was instrumental for scholars, linguists, and theologians in studying and translating biblical and ancient texts, reflecting the period's intellectual engagement with diverse cultural and religious manuscripts.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"1","iso":"heb","year":1669,"type":"scan","provider":"Thomas Roycroft","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HEBHEPT_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1669)-Lexicon-Heptaglotton-Vol.-1-of-2","language":{"iso":"heb","glotto_id":"hebr1245","iso1":"he","name":"Hebrew","autonym":"Israeli Hebrew","level":"L","area":"Also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, Panama, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.10565,"longitude":35.01788,"population":5000000,"status_id":"1"}}
