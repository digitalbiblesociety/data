McDowall. Kohlmeister also translated the entire gospel of John (mostly extracted from the harmony) and this was published later in 1810, also by W. McDowall, at the expense of the British and Foreign Bible Society. 1000 copies were published. This was very well received and Kohlmeister's translation of the other three gospels was published in 1813. C.F. Burghardt may have been involved in the 1813 publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA version of the Acts and Epistles prepared by the labour of the Moravian missionaries was published by the Society in 1819 and in 1826 a complete edition of the New Testament left the Society's press in London. In 1839 a revised edition of the Acts Epistles and book of Revelation was completed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePsalms was published in 1826 and again in 1830, and Genesis in 1834.
