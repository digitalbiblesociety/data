There are several main varieties, Padang, Rek, Agaar, Bor, Hol, Twic East, Twic, which are distinct enough (though mutually intelligible) to require separate literary standards. Jaang, Jieng or Monyjieng is used as a general term to cover all Dinka languages. Recently Akutmɛ̈t Latueŋ Thuɔŋjäŋ (the Dinka Language Development Association) has proposed a unified written grammar of Dinka.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe language most closely related to Dinka is the Nuer language. The Luo languages are also closely related. The Dinka vocabulary shows considerable proximity to Nubian, which is probably due to medieval interactions between the Dinka people and the kingdom of Alodia.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Dinka are found mainly along the Nile, specifically the west bank of the White Nile, a major tributary flowing north from Uganda, north and south of the Sudd marsh in South Kordofan state of Sudan as well as Bahr el Ghazal region and Upper Nile state of South Sudan.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"195","iso":"din","year":2014,"type":"book","provider":"Discipleship Press","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"DIPBSS_DBS_HS/Dinka-(2014)-Matthew-(Welpi-th-E-G-GGr-Mathayo)","language":{"iso":"din","glotto_id":"din","name":"Dinka","level":"L","country_id":"SS"}}
