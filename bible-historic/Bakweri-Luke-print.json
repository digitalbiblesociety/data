The Bakweri (or Kwe) are a Bantu ethnic group of the Republic of Cameroon.\u003cbr\u003eDuring colonial times, the Bakweri people were forced to move from their fertile farmland to inferior terrain on the southern slopes of Mount Cameroon. Amidst this injustice, they were introduced to Christianity.  In time, many people began attending church and identifying as Christian, but the Scriptures and language used in the church services was not understandable. As a result, they continued to practice their traditional religion alongside Christianity. \u003cbr\u003eNow that the Gospels of Mark and Luke have been published and are being used in the churches, the people are “hungry for the Word.” Forty-five are meeting regularly in small neighborhood groups to listen to the audio recording of Mark and discuss what they have heard.
