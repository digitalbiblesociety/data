Nonnberg Convent Psalter - Illuminated (WDL-8959)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginating from the Upper Rhine region around 1250–60, this psalter is notable for its artful representation of saints within psalter initials. Many saints are identifiable through their attributes, like Saint Catherine with her wheel and Saint George slaying the dragon. Traditionally, David is depicted with his harp inside the initial at the psalter's beginning, with the Holy Spirit's symbol, the dove, above him. Gold and silver majuscules on blue or rose grounds, adorned with fine white ornamentation, mark each psalm or canticle's beginning. The manuscript features a plethora of motifs in red and blue ink drawings, including leaf and tendril motifs, birds, fish, dragons, angel heads, and more, woven into fill patterns at line endings. This magnificent psalter has resided in various locations over the centuries, including the Cistercian monastery of Stams in the Tirol and the Benedictine nunnery in Salzburg, before joining the collection at the Bavarian State Library, where it is now preserved.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/8959","filesize":"205","iso":"lat","year":1250,"type":"illuminated","provider":"Diocese of Basel, Switzerland","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"LATNONN_DBS_HS/Latin-(1250-ca.)-Nonnberg-Convent-Psalter-Illuminated-(WDL-8959)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
