{"id":"Rotuman-John-print","abbr":"RTMPOR","title":"Rotuman - John (Print)","title_vernacular":"Rotuman - Ioane","description":"Rotuman, also referred to as Rotunan, Rutuman, or Fäeag Rotuạm (citation form: Faega Rotuma), is an Austronesian language spoken by the indigenous people of the South Pacific island group of Rotuma, an island with a Polynesian-influenced culture that was incorporated as a dependency into the Colony of Fiji in 1881. Classification of Rotuman is difficult because of the large number of loan words from Samoan and Tongan, as a result of much cultural exchange over the history of the Pacific. Linguist Andrew Pawley groups the language with the West Fijian languages in a West Fijian–Rotuman branch of the Central Pacific subgroup of Oceanic languages.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"12","iso":"rtm","year":1975,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"RTMPOR_DBS_HS/Rotuman-John-(print)","language":{"iso":"rtm","glotto_id":"rotu1241","name":"Rotuman","autonym":"Fäeag Rotuma","level":"L","location":"Fiji","area":"Rotuma Island.","country_id":"FJ","latitude":-12.50082,"longitude":177.06614,"population":2500,"status_id":"6b"}}
