More than 6 million Iranians speak Azerbai- jani, Kurdish, and Armenian as well. Afghan, or Dari Persian, is spoken by a large proportion of the inhabitants of Afghanistan, although many speak Pashto, Balochi, Tadjiki, or Uzbek as a mother tongue. The Aryan ancestors of the present-day Iranians settled there about 2000 B.C. and soon divided into the Medes and Persians. The Persian Empire, founded by King Cyrus about 550 B.C., was the short-lived but glorious beginning of Persian political history. Thereafter the great arid plateau of Persia fell successively under the domination of the Greeks, Parthians, Arabs, Turks, and Mongols.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"95","iso":"pes","year":1920,"type":"scan","provider":"The British and Foreign Bible Society","org_id":"british-and-foreign-bible-society","digitizer":"","archive_id":"PESTHN_DBS_HS/Farsi-(1920)-Persian-Bible-(Tarjumeh-ye-Ghadeem)","language":{"iso":"pes","glotto_id":"west2369","name":"Iranian Persian","autonym":"فارسی","level":"L","area":"Widespread.
