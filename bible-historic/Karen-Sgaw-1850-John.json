They are of unclear affiliation within the Sino-Tibetan languages. The Karen languages are written using the Karen script. The three main branches are Sgaw, Pwo, and Pa'O. Karenni (also known as Kayah or Red Karen) and Kayan (also known as Padaung) are a branch of the Karen languages. They are unusual among the Sino-Tibetan languages in having a subject–verb–object word order; other than Karen, Bai, and the Chinese languages, Sino-Tibetan languages have a subject-object-verb order. This is likely due to the influence of neighboring Mon and Tai languages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Sgaw, who refer to themselves as ‘Kanyaw’, are the largest of the Karen groups. They number more than half a million in Burma, where they live both in the lowlands of the Irrawaddy Delta and Tenasserim and in the hill areas of the Pegu Range. There are also 50,000 Sgaw Karens in Thailand, where they are known as Yang Khao, meaning White Karen. Burmese historians claim that inscriptions suggest the existence of Sgaw Karens in Lower Burma since the 13th century. The Paku are a closely related group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1839 John; 1843 New Testament; 1848 Genesis; 1853 Bible by American and Foreign BS, Tavoy Translated by Francis Mason, American Baptist Missionary Union.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"41","iso":"ksw","year":1850,"type":"scan","provider":"American Mission Press","org_id":"american-baptist-mission-press","digitizer":"","archive_id":"KSWOKV_DBS_HS/Karen-Sgaw-(1850)-John","language":{"iso":"ksw","glotto_id":"sgaw1245","name":"S'gaw Karen","autonym":"ကညီကျိာ်","level":"L","location":"Central Myanmar","area":"Ayeyawaddy (Irrawaddy) delta area, Taninthayi (Tenasserim) Division, the Pegu range between the Irrawaddy and Sittang rivers, the eastern hills Kayin (Karen) state.
