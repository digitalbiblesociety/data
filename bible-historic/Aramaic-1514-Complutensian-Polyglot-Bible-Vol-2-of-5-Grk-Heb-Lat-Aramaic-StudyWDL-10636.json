This ambitious project, led by Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, aimed to facilitate advanced scriptural studies at the newly revitalized University of Alcalá de Henares. The printing, executed by Arnaldo Guillén de Brocar, required the creation of new typefaces, particularly noted for the beauty of the Greek characters. Volumes two and three of the Bible include the remainder of the Old Testament, presented in parallel columns of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, underscoring the work's scholarly and typographic significance. This polyglot Bible marked a significant advancement in biblical scholarship, offering scholars unprecedented access to scriptural texts in their original languages alongside their translations, fostering a deeper understanding and study of the Bible during the Renaissance. The inclusion of Aramaic translations, such as the Targum Onkelos, and comprehensive dictionaries for Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek in the later volumes, further contributed to the work's utility for scholarly biblical study.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/10636","filesize":"223","iso":"aii","year":1514,"type":"study","provider":"Arnao Guillén de Brocar, Alcalá de Henares","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"AII1514_DBS_HS/Aramaic-(1514)-Complutensian-Polyglot-Bible-(Vol-2-of-5)-Grk-Heb-Lat-Aramaic-Study(WDL-10636)","language":{"iso":"aii","glotto_id":"assy1241","name":"Assyrian Neo-Aramaic","autonym":"Sūreṯ","level":"L","location":"Iraq","area":"Northern Iraq, Baghdad, Basrah, Karkuk, Arbil.
