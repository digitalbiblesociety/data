Armenian, a language with a rich literary heritage, is spoken not only in Armenia but also in Turkey and across the global Armenian diaspora. This publication highlights the efforts of the 19th century to provide the Armenian population with access to religious texts in their native language, facilitating personal and communal religious practices. The involvement of the Amsterdam Bible Society in this endeavor underscores the broader Christian missionary and educational movements of the time, aimed at spreading Christian teachings and supporting spiritual development among diverse linguistic and cultural groups. This edition of the New Testament played a role in sustaining the Armenian Christian tradition, especially amidst the challenges faced by Armenians in their historical homeland and in diaspora communities worldwide.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"11","iso":"hye","year":1859,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HYEANT_DBS_HS/Armenian-(1859)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"hye","glotto_id":"nucl1235","iso1":"hy","name":"Armenian","autonym":"հայերէն/հայերեն","level":"L","location":"Azerbaijan","area":"Widespread.
