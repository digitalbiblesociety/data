All Tsimshianic languages are endangered, some with only around 400 speakers. Only around 2,170 people of the ethnic Tsimshian /ˈsɪmʃiən/ population in Canada still speak a Tsimshian language; about 50 of the 1,300 Tsimshian people living in Alaska still speak Coast Tsimshian. Tsimshianic languages are considered by most linguists to be an independent language family, with four main languages: Coast Tsimshian, Southern Tsimshian, Nisg̱a’a, and Gitksan.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"142","iso":"tsi","year":1889,"type":"book","provider":"William Clowes and Sons","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"TSIJHN_DBS_HS/Tsimshian-John-(book)","language":{"iso":"tsi","glotto_id":"nucl1649","name":"Tsimshian","autonym":"Sm'algyax","level":"L","location":"Southwestern Canada","area":"North coast British Columbia.
