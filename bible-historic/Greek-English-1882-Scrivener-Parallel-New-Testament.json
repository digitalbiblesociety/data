A. Scrivener in 1881. Scrivener, a respected scholar of the late nineteenth century, worked on the Textus Receptus (TR), also known as the Received Text. This edition of the Greek New Testament is significant for its basis on the Traditional or Byzantine Text, which itself is grounded in a vast collection of ancient handwritten New Testament manuscripts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Textus Receptus has been a cornerstone in the history of biblical translations, particularly noted for its role in the translation of the King James Version (KJV) New Testament. The parallel nature of Scrivener's edition, juxtaposing the Greek text of the Textus Receptus with the English text of the KJV, offers a valuable resource for comparative study and analysis. This parallel format allows scholars, theologians, and students to closely examine the translation choices made in the KJV and to understand the textual basis of this influential English translation of the New Testament. Scrivener's work in editing and presenting the Textus Receptus thus continues to be an important contribution to biblical scholarship and the study of New Testament texts.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"53","iso":"grc","year":1882,"type":"study","provider":"Arthur Hinds and Company","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCSCRI_DBS_HS/Greek-English-(1882)-Scrivener-Parallel-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
