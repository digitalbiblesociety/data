Produced and edited by Jacob ben Haim (Yaakov ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah), this work was published by Daniel Bomberg in Venice between 1524 and 1525. The Mikraot Gedolot is a seminal printing of the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Hebrew Masoretic text.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis edition is historically significant as it is believed to have been the source text (Textus Receptus) for the Hebrew Old Testament used by the translators of the King James Version of the Bible in 1611. Jacob ben Haim, a Jewish Masoretic scholar who later converted to Christianity, played a crucial role in its production and editing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe creation of the Mikraot Gedolot or Second Rabbinic Bible was a monumental achievement in typesetting, especially considering the technological limitations of the early printing press. The meticulous assembly of Hebrew letters, vowels, and accents for this edition was an arduous and innovative process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBen Hayyim used the best Hebrew manuscripts available to him at the time. While there has been some debate over the quality of the manuscripts he had access to, Masoretic scholar Ginsburg has supported the notion that this edition was a good representation of the Ben Asher text. Ginsburg's own highly-regarded editions of the Hebrew Bible, printed by the British and Foreign Bible Society, were indeed based on ben Hayyim's Second Rabbinic Bible or Mikraot Gedolot, further emphasizing its importance and influence in the field of Hebrew biblical scholarship.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"1","iso":"heb","year":1524,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"HEBRABB_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1524)-The-Second-Rabbinic-Bible-(Mikraot-Gedolot)-Volume-2","language":{"iso":"heb","glotto_id":"hebr1245","iso1":"he","name":"Hebrew","autonym":"Israeli Hebrew","level":"L","area":"Also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, Panama, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.10565,"longitude":35.01788,"population":5000000,"status_id":"1"}}
