Japanese, spoken by approximately 128 million people, is the sole official language of Japan and part of the Japonic language family. Despite its rich linguistic heritage, which includes the use of kanji and kana scripts, the introduction of Christianity and its scriptures encountered various challenges over centuries. Christianity first reached Japan in 1549 with Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier, who brought translations of Christian texts, initiating efforts to translate the New Testament into Japanese. However, these early translations, including those by Juan Fernandez and Manoel Barreto, were not printed, and a 1613 New Testament print in Kyoto has not survived. Following a period of suppression, the 19th century saw a resurgence in Christian missionary activity, leading to the translation and publication of the Bible in Japanese. The Romanized version of the Psalms in 1914 marks a continuation of these efforts, reflecting both the adaptation of Christian teachings to Japanese linguistic practices and the ongoing interest in making these religious texts accessible to a broader Japanese audience.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"237","iso":"jpn","year":1914,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"JPNSHIH_DBS_HS/Japanese-(1914)-Psalms-(Shihen)-in-Romanji-Script","language":{"iso":"jpn","glotto_id":"nucl1643","iso1":"ja","name":"Japanese","autonym":"日本語","level":"L","location":"Japan","area":"Widespread.
