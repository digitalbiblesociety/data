{"id":"Greek-Latin-1565-Beza-Bible-NT","abbr":"GRCBEZA","title":"Greek-Latin (1565) Beza Bible (NT)","title_vernacular":"Βίβλος του Beza (1565, Καινή Διαθήκη)","description":"Theodore Beza, a key figure in the Protestant Reformation and a disciple of John Calvin, made significant contributions to Biblical scholarship with the 1565 Beza Bible (New Testament). Beza, who succeeded Calvin as a spiritual leader in Geneva, released an edition of the Greek New Testament that featured parallel columns of the Latin Vulgate and his own translation, first published in 1556 with the earliest known edition from 1559. This work was distinguished by enriched and expanded annotations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the preparation of this Greek text, and more notably for the second edition in 1582, Beza possibly utilized two important manuscripts: the Codex Bezae or Cantabrigensis, later donated to the University of Cambridge, and the Codex Claromontanus, discovered in Clermont and now in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France in Paris. However, Beza's work was chiefly influenced by the 1550 edition of Robert Estienne, which was based on Erasmus's editions. This influence was significant in shaping future Biblical studies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeza's Latin version and his extensive notes, reputedly published over a hundred times, greatly facilitated a clearer understanding of the New Testament. While some critics argue that Beza's interpretation was overly influenced by his doctrine of predestination, his contributions to New Testament scholarship are widely recognized as substantial and beneficial.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"143","iso":"grc","year":1565,"type":"study","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCBEZA_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
