His significant contributions to the revival of Greek learning in England marked him as one of the leading educators of his time. Cheke served as tutor to Prince Edward, who would later become King Edward VI, and occasionally to Princess Elizabeth. With strong Reformist leanings in religious matters, his public career included roles as provost of King's College, Cambridge, Member of Parliament, and, briefly, Secretary of State during the reign of King Edward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the ascent of Queen Mary in 1553 dramatically altered his trajectory. His Reformist sympathies at odds with the new regime, Cheke chose voluntary exile abroad, initially with royal permission. His situation worsened when he overstayed this licence, leading to his capture and imprisonment in 1556. Faced with the threat of execution, possibly by burning, Cheke made a forced public recantation, aligning himself with the Church of Rome. This decision, born from fear, haunted him until his death shortly thereafter, as he grappled with remorse for abandoning his true beliefs. Despite this troubled end, Cheke's character, teachings, and reputation continued to be held in high regard and admiration.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"2","iso":"eng","year":1550,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGCHE_DBS_HS/English-(1550)-John-Cheke-Matthew-(1843-Reprint)","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
