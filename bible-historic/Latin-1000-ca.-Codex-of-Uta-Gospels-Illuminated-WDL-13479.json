Codex of Uta - Gospels - Illuminated (WDL-13479)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Codex of Uta, illuminated for Abbess Uta of Niedermünster (1002−25), is a Bavarian Gospel manuscript of exceptional significance. Described by Georg Swarzenski as \"perhaps the most important Western illuminated manuscript of its period,\" its uniqueness lies in the nuanced interplay between its text and the accompanying miniatures. The text amalgamates various sources, including the Bible, theological, mathematical, and musical writings, and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, translated by Johannes Scotus Eriugena (circa 800−circa 877).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScholar Bernhard Bischoff attributes the codex to Hartwig, a poet and scholar who was a monk at Saint Emmeram and a contemporary of Abbess Uta. The lectionary's casket, made of gold, enamel, and filigree work, contemporaneous with the codex, showcases a portrait of Christ in majesty and stylistically relates to the Saint Emmeram portal in Ratisbon (now Regensburg) from the mid-11th century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOriginally belonging to the Niedermünster convent in Ratisbon, the manuscript was transferred to Munich in 1811, symbolizing a rich blend of religious, cultural, and artistic heritage from the early medieval period.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/13479","filesize":"41","iso":"lat","year":1000,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"LATUTA_DBS_HS/Latin-(1000-ca.)-Codex-of-Uta-Gospels-Illuminated-(WDL-13479)","language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","level":"A","country_id":"VA","latitude":41.90264,"longitude":12.45021,"status_id":"3"}}
