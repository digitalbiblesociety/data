Judson, an American missionary, devoted his life to translating the Bible into Burmese and establishing Baptist churches throughout the country. This effort not only introduced Christianity to Myanmar but also provided the Burmese-speaking population with their first access to the New Testament in their native language. Judson's work in translation and church establishment positioned him as a pioneering figure in the history of missionary work in Myanmar and among the first American missionaries to work abroad. His contributions are pivotal in the spread of Christianity in Myanmar, fostering the growth of the Baptist denomination and enhancing religious diversity in the region.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"241","iso":"mya","year":1837,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"MYABJB_DBS_HS/Burmese-(1837)-Judson-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"mya","glotto_id":"nucl1310","iso1":"my","name":"Burmese","autonym":"Myanmar","level":"L","location":"Central Myanmar","area":"South, central, and adjacent areas.
