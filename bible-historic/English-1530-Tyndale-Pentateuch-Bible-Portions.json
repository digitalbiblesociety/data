These books, collectively known as the Pentateuch, include Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Tyndale's work on the Pentateuch was pioneering, particularly as it was among the first English translations done directly from Hebrew, diverging from the traditional Latin Vulgate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis direct approach to translation was aligned with the broader aims of the Reformation, which sought to make religious texts more accessible to the public, especially to those who only spoke and read English. The publication of Tyndale's Pentateuch in 1530 was made possible by advancements in printing technology, significantly enhancing the distribution of these texts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTyndale's translations had a lasting impact on the development of the English language and on subsequent English Bible translations, influencing the style and language of future versions, including the King James Bible. Despite facing severe opposition from the Church authorities, leading to his execution in 1536, Tyndale's work on the Pentateuch and other biblical texts left an indelible mark on English religious and literary history.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"44","iso":"eng","year":1530,"type":"scan","provider":"GreatSite.com","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGTNT_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
