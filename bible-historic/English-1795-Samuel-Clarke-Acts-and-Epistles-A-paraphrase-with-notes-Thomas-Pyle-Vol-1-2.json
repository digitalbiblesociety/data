In 1699, he published two treatises, \"Three Practical Essays on Baptism, Confirmation and Repentance,\" and \"Some Reflections on that part of a book called Amyntor, or a Defence of Milton's Life,\" which discussed the writings of the Primitive Fathers and the Canon of the New Testament. Clarke's significant contributions to biblical literature began in 1701 with \"A Paraphrase upon the Gospel of St Matthew,\" followed by paraphrases on the Gospels of St Mark and St Luke in 1702, and a volume on St John shortly afterward. These works were later printed together in two volumes, going through several editions. Clarke's paraphrases aimed to make the Gospels more accessible and understandable, though his plan to paraphrase the entire New Testament remained unfulfilled. His works are an important part of early 18th-century religious literature, reflecting the era's theological and intellectual currents.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"321","iso":"eng","year":1795,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGSCB_DBS_HS/English-(1795)-Samuel-Clarke-Acts-and-Epistles-(A-paraphrase-with-notes-Thomas-Pyle)-Vol-1-2","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
