(1000, Illuminiert)","description":"The Psalter of Leopold III, dating from the 11th century, served as the prayer book for Leopold III, Margrave of Austria, founder of Klosterneuburg Monastery in 1114. This illuminated manuscript contains not only a psalter and Latin prayers but also the Klosterneuburger Gebet, an Old High German prayer for the forgiveness of sins. The codex includes an exchange of letters between Saint Jerome and Pope Saint Damasus I, Jeromeâ€™s preface to the Psalms, a commentary on the Psalms by Saint Augustine, the Athanasian Creed, among other documents. Leopold III, canonized in 1485 and known as Saint Leopold the Pious, is Austria's patron saint. Born into the Babenberg family, which rose to prominence in Bavaria in the 10th century, Leopold became Margrave of Austria in 1096. He was notable for his pious works, including the founding of Klosterneuburg, Heiligenkreuz, and Kleinmariazell monasteries. His donation of this codex to Klosterneuburg signifies the deep religious and cultural importance of the manuscript, reflecting the intertwined nature of faith, governance, and art in medieval Europe.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/19513","filesize":"4","iso":"goh","year":1000,"type":"illuminated","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GOHLEO_DBS_HS/German-High-(1000-ca.)-Psalter-of-Lepold-III-Illuminated-(WDL-17194)","language":{"iso":"goh","glotto_id":"oldh1241","name":"Old High German (ca. 750-1050)","level":"H","country_id":"DE","status_id":"9"}}
