There are two dialects known as Kwoma (Washkuk) and Nukuma. The Kwoma dialect or \"hill people\" is located in the Washkuk Hills which is a range of mountains on the north side of the Sepik. The Nukuma dialect or \"headwater people\" live to the north and west of the Washkuk range along the Sepik River. Kwoma is considered an endangered language with an estimated 2,925 native speakers worldwide.","collections":"genesis","ref":"","filesize":"159","iso":"kmo","year":1974,"type":"genesis","provider":"Wycliffe Bible Translators","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"The Long Now Foundation","archive_id":"KMOWBT_DBS_HS/Kwoma-(1974)-Genesis-Portion-(Ol-Testamen-Noma)","language":{"iso":"kmo","glotto_id":"kwom1262","name":"Kwoma","autonym":"Washkuk","level":"L","location":"Papua New Guinea, Map 5","area":"East Sepik Province, Ambunti District, Sepik and Sanchi river areas. 12 villages.","country_id":"PG","latitude":-4.08721,"longitude":142.66438,"population":3000,"status_id":"5"}}
