This manuscript, written on parchment, was critically examined and edited by B.H. Cowper in 1860, following the earlier description by C.G. Woide. Utilizing paleography, a study of comparative writing styles, scholars have ascertained its creation in the fifth century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt encompasses most of the Greek Old Testament and the complete Greek New Testament, making it a crucial witness to the biblical text's early form. The Codex Alexandrinus is classified among the four Great uncial codices, a term referring to manuscripts containing the entirety of both the Old and New Testaments in uncial, or large, script. This codex, along with Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, is among the earliest and most comprehensive manuscripts of the Bible, providing invaluable insight into the text's history and transmission. Its significance lies not only in its age but also in its contribution to our understanding of the biblical text in its early forms.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"19","iso":"grc","year":1860,"type":"scan","provider":"Edinburgae, Williams \u0026 Norgate","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCALEX_DBS_HS/Greek-(1860)-Novum-Testamentum-(Alexandrinus-Codex)","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
