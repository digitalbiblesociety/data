Bar Salibi, who died in 1171, was a prominent Assyrian metropolitan bishop born in Melitene. He is highly regarded for his extensive literary contributions, including poems, prayers, a treatise against heresy, and translations of Aristotle's works into Syriac. His biblical commentaries are particularly well-preserved with significant manuscript evidence. This manuscript, written in Serto script, a Syriac script that developed in the 8th century, is a testament to the enduring tradition of manuscript production among West Syriac scribes. Serto, meaning “line,” became the most-used Syriac script. Syriac, an eastern dialect of Aramaic, was spoken by Christians in regions between the Roman Empire and the Arabian Sea from the 1st to the 12th century.","collections":"historic","ref":"https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7070","filesize":"130","iso":"syr","year":1941,"type":"study","provider":"World Digital Library","org_id":"","digitizer":"World Digital Library","archive_id":"SYROLD_DBS_HS/Syriac-(1941)-Gospels-and-Commentary-(WDL-7070)","language":{"iso":"syr","glotto_id":"syr","name":"Syriac","level":"L","country_id":"IQ","population":858080}}
