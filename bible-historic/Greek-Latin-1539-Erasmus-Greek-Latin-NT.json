Erasmus, who sought to rejuvenate the Church through the \"philosophy of Christ,\" dedicated his life to studying and publishing the Bible and early Church writings, with a particular focus on the Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eErasmus's work involved two major projects: collating Greek texts and creating a fresh Latin New Testament. Beginning in 1512, he embarked on refining the Latin New Testament by collating Vulgate manuscripts to craft a critical edition, aiming to improve the Latin used in biblical texts, famously stating, \"It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the purpose of publishing a fresh Latin translation was evident, the inclusion of the Greek text alongside it was less clear. Erasmus stated, \"There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me,\" indicating his intent to allow readers to verify the quality of his Latin version against the Greek. He included the Greek text to address issues of poor translation and textual corruption, highlighting discrepancies caused by translators' errors or scribes' alterations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially named \"Novum Instrumentum omne\" (\"All of the New Teaching\") and later \"Novum Testamentum omne\" (\"All of the New Testament\"), Erasmus's work underscores his belief in the importance of a text where the Greek and Latin versions were consistently comparable, forming the core of the church's New Testament tradition. This work significantly contributed to the understanding and accessibility of biblical texts in the original languages and helped lay the foundation for future biblical scholarship and translations.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"404","iso":"grc","year":1539,"type":"study","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCERAS_DBS_HS","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
