{"id":"Tzeltal-Chilon-John-print","abbr":"TZETOT","title":"Tzeltal Chilon - John (Print)","title_vernacular":"Tzeltal Chilon - Snijil Yajwanej","description":"Tzeltal, or Tseltal, is a Mayan language spoken in the Mexican state of Chiapas, mostly in the municipalities of Ocosingo, Altamirano, Huixtán, Tenejapa, Yajalón, Chanal, Sitalá, Amatenango del Valle, Socoltenango, Las Rosas, Chilón, San Juan Cancuc, San Cristóbal de las Casas and Oxchuc. Tzeltal is one of many Mayan languages spoken near this eastern region of Chiapas, including Tzotzil, Chʼol, and Tojolabʼal, among others. There is also a small Tzeltal diaspora in other parts of Mexico and the United States, primarily as a result of unfavorable economic conditions in Chiapas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe area in which Tzeltal is spoken can be divided in half by an imaginary north-south line; to the west, near Oxchuc, is the ancestral home of the Tzeltal people, predating Spanish colonials, while the eastern portion was settled primarily in the second half of the twentieth century. Partially as a result of these migrations, during which the Tzeltal people and other cultural groups found each other in close proximity, four different dialects of Tzeltal have been described: north, central (including Oxchuc), south, and southeast, though the southeastern dialect is today spoken only by a few elderly and geographically dispersed speakers. It is a living language with some 371,730 speakers as of 2005, including approximately 50,000 monolinguals.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"4","iso":"tzh","year":2001,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"TZETOT_DBS_HS/Tzeltal-Chilon-John-(print)","language":{"iso":"tzh","glotto_id":"tzel1254","name":"Tzeltal","autonym":"Batsʼil Kʼop","level":"L","location":"Eastern Central Mexico","area":"East central Chiapas, Oxchuc area.","country_id":"MX","latitude":16.63841,"longitude":-92.27861,"population":557000,"status_id":"5"}}
