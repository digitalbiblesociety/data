This work is the second edition of Griesbach's two-volume \"Novum Testamentum Graece,\" initially released in 1774-1775. Johann Jakob Griesbach, a Professor of the New Testament at the University of Jena in Germany, is acknowledged as one of the pioneering figures in modern textual criticism of the Bible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGriesbach's groundbreaking theory categorized various versions of New Testament texts into three distinct families: Western, Alexandrian, and Constantinopolitan. He developed a set of fifteen criteria for this classification, which he detailed in the Latin Prolegomena of volume 1 in the second edition. This methodological approach was a significant advancement in understanding the textual variations and transmission of the New Testament.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVolume 2 of this edition encompasses the Book of Acts, the Pauline epistles, the Catholic epistles, and the Book of Revelation. Griesbach's work laid foundational principles for textual criticism, influencing subsequent scholarship in biblical studies and contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the New Testament's textual history.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"28","iso":"grc","year":1809,"type":"scan","provider":"Dommer","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GRCGRIE_DBS_HS/Greek-(1809)-Novum-Testamentum-(Griesbach)-Vol.-1-2","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"}}
