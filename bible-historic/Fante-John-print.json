{"id":"Fante-John-print","abbr":"FATBSG","title":"Fante - John (Print)","title_vernacular":"Mfantse - Yohan","description":"Fante, also known as Fanti, Fantse, or Mfantse, is one of the three principal members of the Akan dialect continuum, along with Asante and Akuapem, the latter two collectively known as Twi, with which it is mutually intelligible. It is principally spoken in the central and southern regions of Ghana as well as in settlements in other regions in western Ghana, Ivory Coast, as well as in Liberia, Gambia and Angola.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFante is the common dialect of the Fante people, whose communities each have their own subdialects, such as Agona, Anomabo, Abura, and Gomoa, all of which are mutually intelligible. Schacter and Fromkin describe two main Fante dialect groups: Fante 1, which uses a syllable-final /w/ and thus distinguishes kaw (\"dance\") and ka (\"bite\"); and Fante 2, where these words are homophonous. A standardized form of Fante is taught in primary and secondary schools. Many Fantes are bilingual or bidialectal and most can speak Twi.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"259","iso":"fat","year":2011,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"FATBSG_DBS_HS/Fante-John-(print)","language":{"iso":"fat","name":"Fanti","level":"L","country_id":"GH"}}
