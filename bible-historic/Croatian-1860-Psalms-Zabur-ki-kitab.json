{"id":"Croatian-1860-Psalms-Zabur-ki-kitab","abbr":"HRVPSA","title":"Croatian (1860) Psalms","title_vernacular":"Zabúr kí kitáb","description":"Serbo-Croatian is, with Slovenian and Macedonian, an official language of Yugoslavia. It is spoken by 8 million people in the Republic of Serbia, 4 million in the Croatian Republic, and 3-5 million in the Republics of Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Monte-negro. Serbo-Croatian is essentially a homogeneous linguistic community, although sight regional dialects can be noted, and Serbian and Croatian were earlier listed as separate tongues. Despite the linguistic relationship of these five Yugoslav (mean- ing ‘South Slav’) peoples, they have historically been separated by political and cultural factors. The Croats, with their Slovene neighbors, were long associated with Austria and Hungary, which explains the predominance of Roman Catholics among them and the use of Roman script. The other Serbo-Croatian- speaking peoples are primarily Eastern Orthodox and use the Cyrillic character.
