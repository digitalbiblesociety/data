This translation, primarily from the original Hebrew and Greek texts rather than the Latin Vulgate, played a crucial role in shaping the German language, akin to the influence of the King James Version on English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Luther Bible has undergone several revisions while largely preserving Luther's initial work. The 1984 revision adapted it to the new German orthography, and a further revision in 1999 introduced changes like updating \"Weib\" (an old term for woman) to \"Frau\" (the modern term). However, the language retains some archaic elements, posing challenges for non-native German learners. In 2017, another update was released, restoring some of Luther's original, more forceful expressions that had been softened in earlier versions. The enduring significance of the Luther Bible extends beyond its religious impact, influencing the development of the German language and culture over the centuries.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"3","iso":"deu","year":1535,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"DEUL45_DBS_HS/German-(1535)-Luther-Bible-(Biblia-Das-ist-Die-gantze-heilige-Schrifft)","language":{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","level":"L","location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"DE","latitude":48.648954,"longitude":12.467623,"population":76100000,"status_id":"1"}}
