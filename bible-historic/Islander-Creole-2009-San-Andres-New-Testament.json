Its vocabulary originates in English, its lexifier, but San Andrés–Providencia creole has its own phonetics and many expressions from Spanish and African languages, particularly Kwa languages (especially Twi and Ewe) and Igbo languages. The language is also known as \"San Andrés Creole\", \"Bende\" and \"Islander Creole English\".","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"3","iso":"icr","year":2009,"type":"book","provider":"Wycliffe Bible Translators","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ICRWBT_DBS_HS/Islander-Creole-(2009)-San-Andres-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"icr","glotto_id":"sana1297","name":"Islander Creole English","autonym":"Islander Creole English","level":"L","location":"Northern Colombia","area":"San Andrés and Providencia Islands.","country_id":"CO","latitude":12.55352,"longitude":-81.70425,"population":12000,"status_id":"6a"}}
