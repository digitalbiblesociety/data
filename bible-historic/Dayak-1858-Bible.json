It is a loose term for over 200 riverine and hill-dwelling ethnic groups, located principally in the central and southern interior of Borneo, each with its own dialect, customs, laws, territory, and culture, although common distinguishing traits are readily identifiable. Dayak languages are categorised as part of the Austronesian languages. The Dayak were animist (Kaharingan and Folk Hindus) in belief; however, since the 19th century there has been mass conversion to Christianity as well as Islam due to the spreading of Abrahamic religions.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"48","iso":"sdo","year":1858,"type":"book","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"SDOHSH_DBS_HS/Dayak-(1858)-Bible","language":{"iso":"sdo","glotto_id":"buka1257","name":"Bukar-Sadung Bidayuh","autonym":"Buka","level":"L","location":"Indonesia, Kalimantan","area":"Sarawak, Serian 1st Division. 30 or more villages.
