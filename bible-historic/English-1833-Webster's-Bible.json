{"id":"English-1833-Webster's-Bible","abbr":"ENGWBR","title":"English (1833) Webster's Bible","title_vernacular":"","description":"English (1833) Webster's Bible Noah Webster's 1833 limited revision of the King James Version, more commonly called the Webster Bible, focused mainly on replacing archaic words and making simple grammatical changes. For example, \"why\" was used instead of \"wherefore\", \"its\" instead of \"his\" for nonliving things, and \"male child\" instead of \"manchild\". Webster introduced euphemisms, changing terms like \"whore\" to \"lewd woman\". He also modified the spelling to reflect American usage, differentiating it from British English. Overall, the changes were minimal, making the Webster Bible almost indistinguishable from the King James Version. It is sometimes referred to as the Common Version, not to be confused with the Common Bible of 1973, which is an ecumenical edition of the Revised Standard Version.","collections":"historic","ref":"","filesize":"206","iso":"eng","year":1833,"type":"scan","provider":"","org_id":"","digitizer":"","archive_id":"ENGWBR_DBS_HS/English-(1833)-Webster's-Bible","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000}}
