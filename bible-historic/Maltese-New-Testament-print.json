{"id":"Maltese-New-Testament-print","abbr":"MLTSNT","title":"Maltese - New Testament (Print)","title_vernacular":"Maltese It-Testment il-Ä did","description":"Maltese (Malti or Lingwa Maltija), is a Semitic language derived from late medieval Sicilian Arabic with Romance superstrata spoken by the Maltese people. It is the national language of Malta and the only official Semitic and Afro-Asiatic language of the European Union. Maltese is a Latinised variety of spoken historical Arabic through its descent from Siculo-Arabic, which developed as a Maghrebi Arabic dialect in the Emirate of Sicily between 831 and 1091. As a result of the Norman invasion of Malta and the subsequent re-Christianisation of the islands, Maltese evolved independently of Classical Arabic in a gradual process of Latinisation. It is therefore exceptional as a variety of historical Arabic that has no diglossic relationship with Classical or Modern Standard Arabic. Maltese is thus classified separately from the 30 varieties constituting the modern Arabic macrolanguage. Maltese is also distinguished from Arabic and other Semitic languages since its morphology have been deeply influenced by Romance languages, namely Italian and Sicilian.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1822 John (with Italian) Church MS, London Translated by Giuseppe Cannolo, a Maltese.;  1829 Gospels Acts (with Latin) CMS, London Translated by M.
