Hawu has been referred to by a variety of names such as Havu, Savu, Sabu, Sawu, and is known to outsiders as Savu or Sabu (thus Havunese, Savunese, Sawunese). Hawu belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, and is most closely related to Dhao (spoken on Rote) and the languages of Sumba. Dhao was once considered a dialect of Hawu, but the two languages are not mutually intelligible.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"2","iso":"hvn","year":2000,"type":"book","provider":"Indonesian Bible Society","org_id":"bible-society-of-indonesia","digitizer":"SABDA","archive_id":"HVNLAI_DBS_HS/Sabu-(2000)-New-Testament-(SABDA)-print","language":{"iso":"hvn","glotto_id":"sabu1255","name":"Sabu","autonym":"Sabu","level":"L","location":"Indonesia, Nusa Tenggara and Southwestern Maluku","area":"Kabupaten Kupang; south of Flores and west of Timor, Sawu and Raijua Islands; Sumba (especially Waingapu and Melolo); Flores Island, Ende; Timor.","country_id":"ID","latitude":-10.5522,"longitude":121.84682,"population":110000,"status_id":"5"}}
