Though the three varieties, Guambiano, moribund Totoró, and the extinct Coconuco are traditionally called languages, Adelaar \u0026 Muysken (2004) believe that they are best treated as a single language. Totoró may be extinct; it had 4 speakers in 1998 out of an ethnic population of 4,000. Guambiano, on the other hand, is vibrant and growing.","collections":"modern","ref":"","filesize":"4","iso":"gum","year":2010,"type":"book","provider":"Wycliffe Bible Translators","org_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","digitizer":"","archive_id":"GUMTBL_DBS_HS/Guambiano-(2010)-New-Testament","language":{"iso":"gum","glotto_id":"guam1248","name":"Guambiano","autonym":"Namrrik","level":"L","location":"Northern Colombia","area":"Central Andes Range near Popayán, Cauca, in concentrated areas.","country_id":"CO","latitude":2.55849,"longitude":-76.58197,"population":21000,"status_id":"5"}}
