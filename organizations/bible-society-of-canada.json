We started thinking that if we want Sperry's works to be read with understanding and to attract the youth and younger adults to church, both of Sperry's works (Hymn and Prayer Book and the Gospels of the Apostles) needed to be revised.\nFrom there, I paid a visit to the Late Bishop Sperry while he lived in Hay River to share with him the idea to revise his works for the reasons stated above, and more importantly to get his permission and blessing to do so. Upon agreement, approval and consent, he prayed for the team that would be tasked in cooperation with the Canadian Bible Society. We also took the project idea to the current Bishop of the Arctic for his blessing.\nPrior to revising the Inuinnaqtun Hymn and Prayer Book, led by the Canadian Bible Society, the Red Book, the Gospels of the Apostles (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) were digitized as written by the Late Bishop Sperry for archival purposes. Translation of the Gospel of Mark has since been completed and processed through the Bible translation processes of the Canadian Bible Society.\nThe team consisting of Minister Paul Williams, Susie Qihuulik Evyagotailak, Millie Qitupana Kuliktana, the Canadian Bible Society and I, Edna Ekhivalak Elias is very pleased to present you these new productions.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"Hivullit Anglicanmiut Inuinnaqtuuqtun Atuutit Qin'ngautillu titiraqtauhimajut Minihitaqpaugaluamit John Sperrymit atuqhugu nutaatqiaq titirauhiliugaq Inuit Tapiriit Kanatamitkunnit (ITK).

It is closely related and physically adjacent to Gitxsan.\nThe earliest linguistic work in Nisga’a was conducted by James Benjamin McCullagh who published \"A Nishg̓a Version of Portions of the Book of Commmon Prayer\" in 1890, and then a Primer in 1897. It included liturgical material as well as hymns.\n\nJames Benjamin McCullagh (1854–1921) was an Anglican missionary in British Columbia; he worked under the supervision of the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS). McCullagh was ordained to the diaconate and priesthood in 1890 by the Bishop of Caledonia. His missionary and educational work was centered on the mission village of Aiyansh, British Columbia.\n\n1890 Nishga Prayer Book:Anglican missionary James Benjamin McCullagh conducted much early linguistic work in Nisga’a, preparing a translation of part of the Book of Common Prayer published in 1890. This include some selection of Scripture namely: Psalms 41:1, 51:3, 51:9, 51:17, 67, 95, 98, 100, 143:2; Proverbs 19:19; Jeremiah 10:24; Ezekiel 18:27; Daniel 9:9-10; Joel 2:13; Matthew 3:2, 5:1-12 (Beatitudes), 5:16, 6:20, 7:12, 7:21, 11:28; Luke 1:46-55 (Magnificat), 1:68-79 (Benedictus), 2:29-32 (Nunc Domittis), 2:2-4 (Lord’s Prayer); John 3:16; 1 Corinthians 9:7, 11, 13-14, 11:24-25; 2 Corinthians 9:6-7, 13:14; Galatians 6:6, 6:10; 1 Timothy 1:15, 6:7, 6:17; Hebrews 6:10, 13:16; 1 John 1:8-9, 3:17 and a metrical form of Psalm 23 in the hymns.\n\nIn 1897 McCullagh produced the \"Nišg̓a Primer\" for students. By then he had adopted the š letter instead of “sh”, which he described as ‘equals s in sure’; and the letter ʻl, which was an el with top left hook, where he had previously used “lth”, which he described as ‘equals Welsh “ll”’.\n\nThe Primer included some selections of Scripture namely: Leviticus 19:18; Psalms 1 and 23; Matthew 5:1-12; Romans 12:19 and 1 John 2:1-11. These two publications were published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK). Scripture selections from the 1890 Nishga Book of Common Prayer and 1897 Nishga Primer were digitised for the Canadian Bible Society, with the help of MissionAssist in May 2020. Note that for digital edition the spellings were harmonised to use the orthography in the 1897 Primer. The Scripture selections were then sorted in canonical order.

After being joined by two other Baptist missionaries in 1799 he moved to the Danish colony of Serampore, where missionaries were looked upon more kindly than in those parts of India where the East India Company held sway.

For many decades we have had to make do with Scriptures that were translated for indigenous languages that are different from our own: most notably Bishop Horden's Moose Cree New Testament and prayer book, and Rev. W. G. Walton's prayer book.\nThe Naskapi Development Corporation has been engaged with this work since the 1990s, facilitated by Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Canadian Bible Society. The Naskapi community grateful acknowledges the help of all who participated with us in producing these Scriptures. Our prayer is that these Words of God will be cherished by our people for generations to come.The Naskapi text is copyright © Naskapi Development Corporation\nNaskapi Development Corporation\nKawawachikamach, Québec G0G 2Z0 Canada\nNew Testament published by the Canadian Bible Society (CBS) © 2007\nCanadian Bible Society\n10 Carnforth Road, Toronto Ontario M4A 2S4 Canada","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Cans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"bible-society-of-canada","language":{"iso":"nsk","glotto_id":"nask1242","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Naskapi","autonym":"ᓇᔅᑲᐱ","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Canada","area":"Quebec and Labrador. 2 communities.
