which is now in Indonesia. His translation in the Ambon dialect was completed and called Segala Surat Perdjanjian Baharu Maha Besar Tuhan Jesus Christos. It was published in Roman script in 1877 by Koninklijke Joh. Enschedé and Sons in Haarlem in the Netherlands, for the National Bible Society of Scotland (now the Scottish Bible Society).  His New Testament was revised by H.C.

He studied at Bala and at Carmarthen, before going to Jesus College, Oxford, which traditionally recruited students from Wales. In 1819 he was ordained into the Anglican Church and became chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford. He was a scholar of Welsh and Hebrew. Whilst at Oxford he transcribed the Mabinogi and other stories from the Red Book of Hergest for Lady Charlotte Guest. He returned to Wales in 1841 and took an active part in Eisteddfod gatherings. He was vicar of Nevern (Nanhyfer) in Pembrokeshire from 1842, and became canon of St Davidʼs Cathedral in 1848. He remained at Nevern until he died in 1852 aged 60. He was buried at Nevern, where there is a memorial to him. In 1859 his nephew published his poetry as Gwaith barddonawl y diweddar Barch. John Jones, M.A., Tegid. Tegid translated the book of Isaiah from Hebrew into English, which was published at Oxford in 1830, and went to a second edition in 1842. His English translation was made to help get feedback for his translation from Hebrew into Welsh. The full Welsh translation was never published, and the original manuscript has been lost. However he submitted selections from his translation of Isaiah to various Welsh language journals and they were published between 1830 and 1846. The surviving selections are Eseia 5:1-7; chapter 10; 14:5-19; 17:12-14; chapters 19 and 23; 45:11; chapter 53; and 58:13-14. Tegid also translated parts of Ruth and Psalms from Hebrew into Welsh. He published these in instalments in Y Gwyliedydd. Selections of Ruth were published in June and July 1833. The selections are Ruth 1:6; 2:5; 3:1, 4, 9-13, 15; and 4:4, 11, 13-14. Tegid followed this with his translation of the Psalms. These were published in monthly instalments between March 1834 and August 1835. He completed the first 20 psalms before giving up because he got no positive feedback. These selections of Scripture from Ruth, Psalms and Isaiah were digitised for the Bible Society in 2021, for the Welsh Scripture Digitisation Project.

Astudiodd yn y Bala ac yng Nghaerfyrddin, cyn mynd ymlaen i Goleg Iesu, Rhydychen, oedd yn draddodiadol yn recriwtio myfyrwyr o Gymru. Ym 1819 cafodd ei ordeinio iʼr Eglwys Anglicanaidd, a daeth yn gaplan Christ Church, Rhydychen. Roedd yn ysgolhaig yn y Gymraeg aʼr Hebraeg. Tra yn Rhydychen trawsgrifiodd Y Mabinogi a straeon eraill o Lyfr Coch Hergest i Lady Charlotte Guest. Dychwelodd i Gymru ym 1841 a chymryd rhan weithredol mewn Eisteddfodau. Roedd yn ficer Nanhyfer yn Sir Benfro o 1842, a chafodd ei ddyrchafu yn Ganon Eglwys Gadeiriol Tyddewi ym 1848. Arhosodd yn Nanhyfer hyd nes iddo farw yn 60 oed ym 1852. Yno y cafodd ei gladdu, ac mae cofeb iddo yno hyd heddiw. Ym 1859 cyhoeddodd ei nai gasgliad oʼi farddoniaeth, Gwaith barddonawl y diweddar Barch. John Jones, M.A., Tegid. Cyfieithodd Tegid lyfr Eseia oʼr Hebraeg iʼr Saesneg. Feʼi cyhoeddwyd yn Rhydychen ym 1830, ac aeth i ail argraffiad ym 1842. Paratodd y cyfieithiad hwn gydaʼr bwriad o gael adborth ar gyfer ei gyfieithiad oʼr Hebraeg iʼr Gymraeg.

Cyhoeddodd y rhain yn Y Gwyliedydd. Cyhoeddwyd rhannau o Lyfr Ruth ym Mehefin a Gorffennaf 1833. Yr adnodau gyhoeddwyd oedd Ruth 1:6; 2:5; 3:1, 4, 9-13, 15; a 4:4, 11, 13-14. Dilynodd y detholiadau hyn gydaʼi gyfieithiadau oʼr Salmau. Cyhoeddwyd y rhain yn fisol rhwng Mawrth 1834 ac Awst 1835.

He then studied at Jesus College, Oxford, which traditionally recruited students from Wales. He gained a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1833, and was appointed Fellow of Jesus College in 1834. He gained his Master of Arts (MA) in 1836. Briscoe was ordained as an Anglican deacon in 1836, and as a priest in 1837. He ministered at Henllan, Denbighshire until 1840. He then returned to Oxford and gained his Bachelor of Divinity (BD) 1858. Briscoe was an excellent scholar and tutor in the biblical languages of Hebrew and Greek. As well as his native Welsh he also knew English, French and German. Briscoe left Oxford in 1858 and spent the rest of his life as vicar of Holyhead on Anglesey. From 1877 he was also Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral. He died unmarried in Holyhead in 1895 aged 82. Whilst he was at Oxford, Briscoe became an admirer of the work of Bishop Lowth, Oxford professor of poetry, who had translated Isaiah in 1778. This translation kept the original poetry of the text in English and was greatly admired and reprinted many times. Briscoe wanted to do the same in Welsh. In 1853 Briscoe completed his own poetic translation of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah from Hebrew, using Bishop Lowthʼs principles. It was published in London in 1854. Briscoeʼs translation of Isaiah was followed by his translations from Hebrew of the Book of Psalms and the Book of Proverbs published together in 1854, and then the Book of the Patriarch Job published in 1855. In 1881 when the Church of England produced the English Revised Version of the New Testament, Briscoe hoped that the Welsh Bishops would commission a similar project in Welsh. Whilst Briscoe was vicar of Holyhead, he translated the New Testament from Greek, which followed the readings of the English Revised Version. In 1894 when it became clear that there would not be an official Welsh Revised Version, Briscoe published his own translation from Greek, at Bangor. Briscoeʼs Old Testament books were scanned from copies in the Bible Society collection at Cambridge University. The New Testament was scanned with thanks to the Special Collections and Archives at Cardiff University. These were digitised by the Bible Society, and then checked and proof-read by Arfon Jones in 2020. All these books of the Bible which were translated by Briscoe (i.e. Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah and the New Testament) have been combined and called: Thomas Briscoeʼs Translation 1894 (Cyfieithiad Briscoe 1894).   This digital collection was produced by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 2020-21.","description_vernacular":"Ganwyd Thomas Briscoe yn Wrecsam ym 1813 a'i addysg yn Ysgol Rhuthun. Aeth ymlaen i astudio yng Ngholeg Iesu, Rhydychen, a oedd yn draddodiadol yn recriwtio myfyrwyr o Gymru. Enillodd radd dosbarth cyntaf Baglor yn y Celfyddydau (BA) ym 1833, a phenodwyd ef yn Gymrawd Coleg Iesu ym 1834. Enillodd radd Meistr yn y Celfyddydau (MA) ym 1836. Ordeiniwyd Briscoe yn ddiacon Anglicanaidd ym 1836, ac yn offeiriad ym 1837. Bu'n gweinidogaethu yn Henllan, Sir Ddinbych hyd 1840. Yna dychwelodd i Rydychen ac ennill gradd Baglor mewn Diwinyddiaeth (BD) yn 1858. Roedd Briscoe yn ysgolhaig ac yn diwtor yn yr ieithoedd Beiblaidd Hebraeg a Groeg. Yn ogystal â'i Gymraeg frodorol roedd hefyd yn siarad Saesneg, Ffrangeg ac Almaeneg.  Gadawodd Briscoe Rydychen ym 1858 a threuliodd weddill ei oes fel ficer yng Nghaergybi ar Ynys Môn. O 1877 roedd hefyd yn Ganghellor Eglwys Gadeiriol Bangor. Bu farw’n ddibriod yng Nghaergybi ym 1895 yn 82 mlwydd oed.  Tra roedd yn Rhydychen, daeth Briscoe yn edmygydd mawr o waith yr Esgob Lowth, athro barddoniaeth Rhydychen, a oedd wedi cyfieithu Llyfr y proffwyd Eseia ym 1778. Roedd y cyfieithiad hwn yn ceisio cadw barddoniaeth y testun gwreiddiol yn y cyfieithiad Saesneg, a chafodd ei ailargraffu lawer gwaith. Roedd Briscoe eisiau gwneud yr un peth yn y Gymraeg. Ym 1853 cwblhaodd Briscoe ei gyfieithiad barddol ei hun o Lyfr y Proffwyd Eseia o’r Hebraeg gwreiddiol, gan ddilyn egwyddorion yr Esgob Lowth. Fe’i cyhoeddwyd yn Llundain ym 1854.  Aeth Briscoe ymlaen i gyfieithu Llyfr y Salmau a Llyfr y Diarhebion o’r Hebraeg, ac fe’u cyhoeddwyd gyda’i gilydd ym 1854. Yna cyfieithodd Lyfr Job, a gyhoeddwyd ym 1855.  Yn ddiweddarach, pan oedd Briscoe yn ficer Caergybi, cyfieithodd y Testament Newydd o'r Roeg. Ym 1881 pan gynhyrchodd Eglwys Loegr Fersiwn Diwygiedig Saesneg o’r Testament Newydd, roedd Briscoe yn gobeithio y byddai Esgobion Cymru yn comisiynu prosiect tebyg yn Gymraeg. Pan ddaeth yn amlwg na fyddai Fersiwn Diwygiedig Cymraeg swyddogol, cyhoeddodd Briscoe ei gyfieithiad ei hun o’r Testament Newydd Groeg, yn dilyn y darlleniadau ddefnyddiai’r Fersiwn Diwygiedig Saesneg, ym Mangor ym 1894.

It was the first book printed in British North America. The Psalms in it are metrical translations into English. The translations are not particularly polished, and not one has remained in use, although some of the tunes to which they were sung have survived (for instance, \"Old 100th\"). However, its production, just 20 years after the Pilgrims' arrival at Plymouth, Massachusetts, represents a considerable achievement. It went through several editions and remained in use for well over a century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn November 2013, one of eleven known surviving copies of the first edition sold at auction for $14.2 million, a record for a printed book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe early residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony brought with them several books of psalms: the Ainsworth Psalter (1612), compiled by Henry Ainsworth for use by Puritan \"separatists\" in Holland; the Ravenscroft Psalter (1621); and the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter (1562), of which there were several editions. Evidently they were dissatisfied with the translations from Hebrew in these several psalters and wished for some that were closer to the original. They hired \"thirty pious and learned Ministers\", including Richard Mather, Thomas Mayhew, and John Eliot, to undertake a new translation, which they presented here. The tunes to be sung to the new translations were the familiar ones from their existing psalters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first printing was the third product of the Stephen Day (sometimes spelled Daye) press, and consisted of a 148 small quarto leaves, including a 12-page preface, \"The Psalmes in Metre\", \"An Admonition to the Reader\", and an extensive list of errata headed \"Faults escaped in printing\". As with subsequent editions of the book, Day printed the book for sale by the first bookseller in British America, Hezekiah Usher, whose shop at that time was also located in Cambridge. An estimated 1,700 copies of the first edition were printed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third edition (1651) was extensively revised by Henry Dunster and Richard Lyon. The revision was entitled The Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs of the Old and New Testament, faithfully translated into English metre. This revision was the basis for all subsequent editions, and was popularly known as the New England Psalter or New England Version. The ninth edition (1698), the first to contain music, included 13 tunes from John Playford's A Breefe Introduction to the Skill of Musick (London, 1654).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe expansion of the neoclassical movement in England led to an evolution in the singing of psalms. These changes found their way to America and subsequently new psalm versions were written. In the early part of the 18th century several updated psalms, notably those written by Tate and Brady and by Isaac Watts, were published. Shortly thereafter several congregations in New England elected to replace the Bay Psalm Book with these new titles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 1718, Cotton Mather undertook the revision of the original Bay Psalm Book which he had studied since youth. Two subsequent revisions were published in 1752, by John Barnard of Marblehead and in 1758 by Thomas Prince. Prince was a clergyman at the Old South Church in Boston. He convinced the members of the congregation of the need to produce a revised, more scholarly, edition of the Bay Psalm Book. Unfortunately, Prince’s version was not accepted outside of his membership and in 1789, the Old South Church reverted to the earlier edition published by Isaac Watts.

The first book of Scriptures in Friulian was this Gospel of Mattew published in 1860 as Lu Vanzèli seònd S. Matìe (Il Vangelo secondo Matteo). It was translated into Friulian by Count Pietro dal Pozzo (volgarizzato in daletto Friulano dal Conte Pietro dal Pozzo). This gospel account was commissioned by Prince Louis Luciano Bonaparte. He was a great linguist who commissioned translations into lesser languages and dialects of Europe. He asked Pietro Zorutti to translate the gospel but he asked too much money, and he asked Abbott Iacopo Pirona, who recommended Conte (Count) Pietro dal Pozzo. Not much is known about him except that the had worked as an actuary at Udine from 1835 to 1844.

They were first printed together in 1690 in Roman typeface. While the New Testament was translated from the Greek, the Old Testament was primarily a translation of the subsequent publication, the King James Bible, with comparison to the Hebrew. Based on the slightly revised 1690 publication of both Old and New Testaments, the 1817 edition was revised further, bringing it nearer to the King James Version. In keeping with developments in the Irish language, the vocabulary and grammar of the 1690 edition were also updated.\n\nBoth Old and New Testaments were translated within the Church of Ireland. The 1602 New Testament was initially translated by John Kearney, Nicolas Walsh (Bishop of Ossory), Maoilín Óg Mac Bruaideadha, and Nehemiah Donnellan (who became archbishop of Tuam). It was completed by, and named after, William O’Donnell (who succeeded Donnellan as archbishop of Tuam) who was assisted by Murtagh King and Domhnal Óg Ó huiginn. O’Donnell had John Fracton print the New Testament. The Old Testament translation was completed around 1638 by William Bedell (initially Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and in later years bishop of Kilmore), with the help of Murtagh King and Séamus Neangail. Robert Boyle first published the Old Testament later in 1685, with assistance from Narcissus Marsh and fresh translation in places by Andrew Sall, with others. It was printed in London. Conversion to digital text was completed by a team led by Craig Ledbetter (New Testament books), and Fearghas MacFhionnlaigh (Psalms) and MissionAssist.\n\nThe Irish which appears in this publication was the scholarly and older standard literary form of classical modern Irish. It differed significantly from the vernacular of the time, but even more so from today’s modern Irish. With its many archaisms, reading the Bedell Bible today is therefore somewhat difficult for the modern reader, akin to reading Shakespeare in English.","description_short":"The 1817 edition of 'An Biobla Naomhta' featuring the Bedell Old Testament and O'Donnell New Testament.

Shocraigh Ó Domhnuill go ndéanfadh John Fracton an Nua Thiomna a chur i gcló.

The vowels are the open Italian vowels; H always represents the aspirate, BH, MH, PH. etc. are aspirated B, M, P, etc.: C and Q represent “click” sounds, of which two only are distinguished in this Dialect: J is used to represent a sound almost identical with that of the French J, or the English Z in “azure”: NG is used to represent the sound of NG in “single,” GN to represent the sound of NG in “singing”: HL represents a sound like that of the Welsh LL in “llan”: HS is used for a sound not heard in European languages, a palatal aspirated S: X has the same sound as in Portuguese, viz. that represented in English by SH in “shepherd”: WS represents a peculiar labial S, for which Lepsius makes no provision. Lepsius’ characters have not been used for the above sounds owing to the extra cost of such printing. In this book the initial letters of the stems of Nouns and Verbs are marked by the use of a Capital letter, for the convenience of those who are beginning to learn the language, which is a “prefixusing” language.

He was a Nubian evangelist in the service of the German Sudan Pioneer Mission. The translation was done under the supervision of Heinrich Schäfer, a professor in the Egyptian Department of the Royal Museum, Berlin who gently edited and revised it.  The 4 Gospel accounts were prepared in Roman script. Matthew was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Hiran Mata Bajsin Nawite. Mark was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Hiran Markus Bajsin Nawite. Luke was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Luka Gadisebul Bajsin Nawite. John was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Hiran Hana Bajsin Nawite. They were each printed separately in 1912.  The Gospel booklets each come with a four-page explanatory leaflet called in German: Für europäische Leser (for European readers). This explains the orthography used, how the characters represent sounds, and how they related to characters in the Arabic alphabet. This was dated November 1912 and written by Heinrich Schäfer in Berlin. The Gospel booklets were printed by Trowitzsch amp Sohn of Berlin SW for the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) in Berlin in 1912.

It is written in Chinese script, and can also be written in a romanised form. John Morrison Chalmers (1825-1899) was a Scottish Protestant missionary and translator in China. Chalmers served with the Congregational London Missionary Society (LMS) and during the late Qing Dynasty China. He wrote several works on the Chinese language. Chalmers developed the basis of a romanisation system for Cantonese. This rendered the language in phonetic characters using the Latin alphabet instead of Chinese characters. It used nine diacritic markers to represent tones. In 1888 this was completed and agreed by a group of missionaries for Christian literature, and called Standard Romanisation In 1894 the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) produced the Gospel of Mark in Cantonese Colloquial in Romanised form, and in 1906 the Bible Society, produced the whole New Testament in Romanised form. By 1914, it had become well established in Hong Kong and Canton. It is the foundation of the current system of Romanisation used by the Hong Kong Government, although the tone markers are not always used today. In 1915 the whole Bible in Cantonese Colloquial (Kwóng-tung wâ) was prepared in romanised form. The new edition in of the revised Chinese Colloquial Bible was produced by W.E.H. Hipwell and K.I. Hipwell, with the help of H.F. North. It was printed for the Shanghai office of the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS). In Cantonese Colloquial was called: Shìng-King San-Yeukₒ Ts‘uēn shue. In English it was called: The New Testament in Cantonese Colloquial. It was printed in 1915 by the Fukuin Printing Co., Ltd., in Yokohama, Japan for the British and Foreign Bible Society in Shanghai. The Cantonese Colloquial Bible was digitised for the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) with the help of MissionAssist in 2019, as a project to mark the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Union
