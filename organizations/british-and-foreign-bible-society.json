He was christened at Llanycil church, on the banks of Llyn Tegid. It is from this lake which he later took his bardic name Ioan Tegid. He studied at Bala and at Carmarthen, before going to Jesus College, Oxford, which traditionally recruited students from Wales. In 1819 he was ordained into the Anglican Church and became chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford. He was a scholar of Welsh and Hebrew. Whilst at Oxford he transcribed the Mabinogi and other stories from the Red Book of Hergest for Lady Charlotte Guest. He returned to Wales in 1841 and took an active part in Eisteddfod gatherings. He was vicar of Nevern (Nanhyfer) in Pembrokeshire from 1842, and became canon of St Davidʼs Cathedral in 1848. He remained at Nevern until he died in 1852 aged 60. He was buried at Nevern, where there is a memorial to him. In 1859 his nephew published his poetry as Gwaith barddonawl y diweddar Barch. John Jones, M.A., Tegid.\nTegid translated the book of Isaiah from Hebrew into English, which was published at Oxford in 1830, and went to a second edition in 1842. His English translation was made to help get feedback for his translation from Hebrew into Welsh. The full Welsh translation was never published, and the original manuscript has been lost. However he submitted selections from his translation of Isaiah to various Welsh language journals and they were published between 1830 and 1846. The surviving selections are Eseia 5:1-7; chapter 10; 14:5-19; 17:12-14; chapters 19 and 23; 45:11; chapter 53; and 58:13-14.\nTegid also translated parts of Ruth and Psalms from Hebrew into Welsh. He published these in instalments in Y Gwyliedydd. Selections of Ruth were published in June and July 1833. The selections are Ruth 1:6; 2:5; 3:1, 4, 9-13, 15; and 4:4, 11, 13-14. Tegid followed this with his translation of the Psalms. These were published in monthly instalments between March 1834 and August 1835. He completed the first 20 psalms before giving up because he got no positive feedback.\nThese selections of Scripture from Ruth, Psalms and Isaiah were digitised for the Bible Society in 2021, for the Welsh Scripture Digitisation Project. The collection has been called Salmau 1-20 a detholiad o Ruth ac Eseia 1830-35 (Ioan Tegid).

Ym 1819 cafodd ei ordeinio iʼr Eglwys Anglicanaidd, a daeth yn gaplan Christ Church, Rhydychen. Roedd yn ysgolhaig yn y Gymraeg aʼr Hebraeg. Tra yn Rhydychen trawsgrifiodd Y Mabinogi a straeon eraill o Lyfr Coch Hergest i Lady Charlotte Guest. Dychwelodd i Gymru ym 1841 a chymryd rhan weithredol mewn Eisteddfodau. Roedd yn ficer Nanhyfer yn Sir Benfro o 1842, a chafodd ei ddyrchafu yn Ganon Eglwys Gadeiriol Tyddewi ym 1848. Arhosodd yn Nanhyfer hyd nes iddo farw yn 60 oed ym 1852.

He then studied at Jesus College, Oxford, which traditionally recruited students from Wales. He gained a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1833, and was appointed Fellow of Jesus College in 1834. He gained his Master of Arts (MA) in 1836.\nBriscoe was ordained as an Anglican deacon in 1836, and as a priest in 1837. He ministered at Henllan, Denbighshire until 1840. He then returned to Oxford and gained his Bachelor of Divinity (BD) 1858. Briscoe was an excellent scholar and tutor in the biblical languages of Hebrew and Greek. As well as his native Welsh he also knew English, French and German. Briscoe left Oxford in 1858 and spent the rest of his life as vicar of Holyhead on Anglesey. From 1877 he was also Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral. He died unmarried in Holyhead in 1895 aged 82.\nWhilst he was at Oxford, Briscoe became an admirer of the work of Bishop Lowth, Oxford professor of poetry, who had translated Isaiah in 1778. This translation kept the original poetry of the text in English and was greatly admired and reprinted many times. Briscoe wanted to do the same in Welsh. In 1853 Briscoe completed his own poetic translation of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah from Hebrew, using Bishop Lowthʼs principles. It was published in London in 1854.\nBriscoeʼs translation of Isaiah was followed by his translations from Hebrew of the Book of Psalms and the Book of Proverbs published together in 1854, and then the Book of the Patriarch Job published in 1855.\nIn 1881 when the Church of England produced the English Revised Version of the New Testament, Briscoe hoped that the Welsh Bishops would commission a similar project in Welsh. Whilst Briscoe was vicar of Holyhead, he translated the New Testament from Greek, which followed the readings of the English Revised Version. In 1894 when it became clear that there would not be an official Welsh Revised Version, Briscoe published his own translation from Greek, at Bangor.\nBriscoeʼs Old Testament books were scanned from copies in the Bible Society collection at Cambridge University. The New Testament was scanned with thanks to the Special Collections and Archives at Cardiff University.\nThese were digitised by the Bible Society, and then checked and proof-read by Arfon Jones in 2020. All these books of the Bible which were translated by Briscoe (i.e. Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah and the New Testament) have been combined and called: Thomas Briscoeʼs Translation 1894 (Cyfieithiad Briscoe 1894). \n This digital collection was produced by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 2020-21.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"Ganwyd Thomas Briscoe yn Wrecsam ym 1813 a'i addysg yn Ysgol Rhuthun. Aeth ymlaen i astudio yng Ngholeg Iesu, Rhydychen, a oedd yn draddodiadol yn recriwtio myfyrwyr o Gymru. Enillodd radd dosbarth cyntaf Baglor yn y Celfyddydau (BA) ym 1833, a phenodwyd ef yn Gymrawd Coleg Iesu ym 1834. Enillodd radd Meistr yn y Celfyddydau (MA) ym 1836. Ordeiniwyd Briscoe yn ddiacon Anglicanaidd ym 1836, ac yn offeiriad ym 1837. Bu'n gweinidogaethu yn Henllan, Sir Ddinbych hyd 1840. Yna dychwelodd i Rydychen ac ennill gradd Baglor mewn Diwinyddiaeth (BD) yn 1858. Roedd Briscoe yn ysgolhaig ac yn diwtor yn yr ieithoedd Beiblaidd Hebraeg a Groeg. Yn ogystal â'i Gymraeg frodorol roedd hefyd yn siarad Saesneg, Ffrangeg ac Almaeneg.\n\nGadawodd Briscoe Rydychen ym 1858 a threuliodd weddill ei oes fel ficer yng Nghaergybi ar Ynys Môn. O 1877 roedd hefyd yn Ganghellor Eglwys Gadeiriol Bangor. Bu farw’n ddibriod yng Nghaergybi ym 1895 yn 82 mlwydd oed.\n\nTra roedd yn Rhydychen, daeth Briscoe yn edmygydd mawr o waith yr Esgob Lowth, athro barddoniaeth Rhydychen, a oedd wedi cyfieithu Llyfr y proffwyd Eseia ym 1778. Roedd y cyfieithiad hwn yn ceisio cadw barddoniaeth y testun gwreiddiol yn y cyfieithiad Saesneg, a chafodd ei ailargraffu lawer gwaith. Roedd Briscoe eisiau gwneud yr un peth yn y Gymraeg. Ym 1853 cwblhaodd Briscoe ei gyfieithiad barddol ei hun o Lyfr y Proffwyd Eseia o’r Hebraeg gwreiddiol, gan ddilyn egwyddorion yr Esgob Lowth. Fe’i cyhoeddwyd yn Llundain ym 1854.\n\nAeth Briscoe ymlaen i gyfieithu Llyfr y Salmau a Llyfr y Diarhebion o’r Hebraeg, ac fe’u cyhoeddwyd gyda’i gilydd ym 1854. Yna cyfieithodd Lyfr Job, a gyhoeddwyd ym 1855.\n\nYn ddiweddarach, pan oedd Briscoe yn ficer Caergybi, cyfieithodd y Testament Newydd o'r Roeg. Ym 1881 pan gynhyrchodd Eglwys Loegr Fersiwn Diwygiedig Saesneg o’r Testament Newydd, roedd Briscoe yn gobeithio y byddai Esgobion Cymru yn comisiynu prosiect tebyg yn Gymraeg.

It is written in Chinese script, and can also be written in a romanised form.\nJohn Morrison Chalmers (1825-1899) was a Scottish Protestant missionary and translator in China. Chalmers served with the Congregational London Missionary Society (LMS) and during the late Qing Dynasty China. He wrote several works on the Chinese language. Chalmers developed the basis of a romanisation system for Cantonese. This rendered the language in phonetic characters using the Latin alphabet instead of Chinese characters. It used nine diacritic markers to represent tones. In 1888 this was completed and agreed by a group of missionaries for Christian literature, and called Standard Romanisation\nIn 1894 the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) produced the Gospel of Mark in Cantonese Colloquial in Romanised form, and in 1906 the Bible Society, produced the whole New Testament in Romanised form. By 1914, it had become well established in Hong Kong and Canton. It is the foundation of the current system of Romanisation used by the Hong Kong Government, although the tone markers are not always used today.\nIn 1915 the whole Bible in Cantonese Colloquial (Kwóng-tung wâ) was prepared in romanised form. The new edition in of the revised Chinese Colloquial Bible was produced by W.E.H. Hipwell and K.I. Hipwell, with the help of H.F. North.

After being joined by two other Baptist missionaries in 1799 he moved to the Danish colony of Serampore, where missionaries were looked upon more kindly than in those parts of India where the East India Company held sway. Carey and his companions established a printing press there and baptised their first Hindu convert to Christianity, Krishna Pal, in the following year.<br>In 1800 Carey produced a translation of the Gospel of Matthew into Bengali in an edition of 500 copies. By the following year he had completed the translation of the entire New Testament into that language and it was printed in an edition of 2,000 copies.<br>The translation of the Old Testament followed in 1809. Carey was a prolific translator and an able linguist; by the time of his death he had translated the Bible or portions of it into 34 different Asian languages and dialects, including Chinese, Hindi and Gujarati, and 200,000 individual copies of Biblical works had rolled off the presses of the Serampore Mission Press.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Beng","versification":"Bengali","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"IN","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-1054-7","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"pivot":{"organization_id":"british-and-foreign-bible-society","bible_id":"BENWYC"},"language":{"iso":"ben","glotto_id":"beng1280","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"bn","name":"Bengali","autonym":"বাংলা","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Bangladesh","area":"West.

It was the first book printed in British North America. The Psalms in it are metrical translations into English. The translations are not particularly polished, and not one has remained in use, although some of the tunes to which they were sung have survived (for instance, \"Old 100th\"). However, its production, just 20 years after the Pilgrims' arrival at Plymouth, Massachusetts, represents a considerable achievement. It went through several editions and remained in use for well over a century.<br><br>In November 2013, one of eleven known surviving copies of the first edition sold at auction for $14.2 million, a record for a printed book.<br><br>The early residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony brought with them several books of psalms: the Ainsworth Psalter (1612), compiled by Henry Ainsworth for use by Puritan \"separatists\" in Holland; the Ravenscroft Psalter (1621); and the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter (1562), of which there were several editions. Evidently they were dissatisfied with the translations from Hebrew in these several psalters and wished for some that were closer to the original. They hired \"thirty pious and learned Ministers\", including Richard Mather, Thomas Mayhew, and John Eliot, to undertake a new translation, which they presented here. The tunes to be sung to the new translations were the familiar ones from their existing psalters.<br><br>The first printing was the third product of the Stephen Day (sometimes spelled Daye) press, and consisted of a 148 small quarto leaves, including a 12-page preface, \"The Psalmes in Metre\", \"An Admonition to the Reader\", and an extensive list of errata headed \"Faults escaped in printing\". As with subsequent editions of the book, Day printed the book for sale by the first bookseller in British America, Hezekiah Usher, whose shop at that time was also located in Cambridge. An estimated 1,700 copies of the first edition were printed.<br><br>The third edition (1651) was extensively revised by Henry Dunster and Richard Lyon. The revision was entitled The Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs of the Old and New Testament, faithfully translated into English metre. This revision was the basis for all subsequent editions, and was popularly known as the New England Psalter or New England Version. The ninth edition (1698), the first to contain music, included 13 tunes from John Playford's A Breefe Introduction to the Skill of Musick (London, 1654).<br><br>The expansion of the neoclassical movement in England led to an evolution in the singing of psalms. These changes found their way to America and subsequently new psalm versions were written. In the early part of the 18th century several updated psalms, notably those written by Tate and Brady and by Isaac Watts, were published. Shortly thereafter several congregations in New England elected to replace the Bay Psalm Book with these new titles.<br><br>In 1718, Cotton Mather undertook the revision of the original Bay Psalm Book which he had studied since youth. Two subsequent revisions were published in 1752, by John Barnard of Marblehead and in 1758 by Thomas Prince. Prince was a clergyman at the Old South Church in Boston. He convinced the members of the congregation of the need to produce a revised, more scholarly, edition of the Bay Psalm Book. Unfortunately, Prince’s version was not accepted outside of his membership and in 1789, the Old South Church reverted to the earlier edition published by Isaac Watts.
