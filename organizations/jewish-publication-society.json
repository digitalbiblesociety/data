The translation project began in 1882 with twenty-two translators working under the editorship of Marcus Jastrow, and expanded to include a committee of translators from both sides of the Atlantic led by Max Margolis. The 1917 Tanakh takes into account the Septuagint, the Targums, the Peshitta, the Vulgate, and numerous other translation traditions. It offers a uniquely Jewish translation for the English-speaking world. The resulting work is still in wide use nearly a century after its original publication.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GB","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0,"laravel_through_key":"jewish-publication-society","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}}],"resources":[],"films":[]}
