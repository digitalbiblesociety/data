Because it is the only English version fully Jewish in style and presentation. It includes Dr. Stern's new version of the \"Tanakh\" (\"Old Testament\") and his highly acclaimed \"Jewish New Testament.\"\nThe Complete Jewish Bible:\n- follows the Hebrew Bible order of the Tanakh's books, the order with which Yeshua (Jesus) was familiar\n- makes no separation between \"Old\" and \"New\" Testaments\n- corrects misinterpretations in the New Testament resulting from anti-Jewish theological bias\n- offers the original Hebrew names for people, places, and concepts, using easy-to-read English transliterations\n- focuses on Messianic prophecy\n- gives the traditional weekly and holiday synagogue readings, plus relevant readings from the \"B'rit Hadashah\" (New Testament)\n\nThe Complete Jewish Bible:\n- reconnects Christians with their Jewish roots and the Jewish people\n- connects Jews with the Jewishness of Messiah Yeshua and Messianic faith\nOther features of this Bible: a comprehensive introduction, a pronouncing explanatory glossary, a reverse glossary, and special maps to aid Bible understanding.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"pivot":{"organization_id":"messianic-jewish-family-bible-society","bible_id":"ENGCJB"},"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}}],"resources":[],"films":[]}
