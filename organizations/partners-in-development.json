Ka Baibala Hemolele (2018) is a presentation of the Hawaiian Bible in the modern Hawaiian orthography. This includes two additional characters: the ‘okina (glottal stop) – a consonant which was left out of the original set of letters that made up the Hawaiian alphabet in 1826, and the kahakō – a macron used to mark elongated vowels. The sounds represented by these two characters were always present in the language but previously unwritten. Quotation marks were added to the text to improve readability and comprehension.\nKa Baibala Hemolele is an accurate and faithful translation of the Holy Scripture, from the original languages, in the modern Hawaiian orthography","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":null,"versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0,"pivot":{"organization_id":"partners-in-development","bible_id":"HAWPDF"},"language":{"iso":"haw","glotto_id":"hawa1245","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Hawaiian","autonym":"ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"United States of America, Alaska and Hawaii","area":"Hawaiian Islands, mainly Ni’ihau Island, Island of Hawai’i, some on all other islands.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"US","latitude":"19.629650","longitude":"-155.429950","population":2000,"status_id":"2","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}}],"resources":[],"films":[]}
