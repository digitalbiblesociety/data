A decisión de facer unha versión galega partindo das linguas orixinais tomouse no ano 1973 contando co apoio do arcebispo de Santiago de Compostela. A coordinación estivo a cargo de Andrés Torres Queiruga e Xosé Fernández Lago.\nNa promoción, xestión e edición, implícáronse tamén o Presidente e o Director de SEPT, Alfonso Zulueta de Haz e Francisco Domínguez. Practicamente a totalidade dos tradutores traballaron de maneira gratuíta. A Xunta de Galicia financiou a primeira edición no ano 1989, de 5.000 exemplares. Máis adiante fixéronse outras dúas edicións máis do mesmo número de exemplares. Actualmente estase levando a cabo unha revisión e actualización para abordar unha cuarta edición que agardamos publicar en formato físico a finais deste ano 2021.\nA presente versión, preparada para a web, é unha adaptación ortográfica da terceira edición (2001).","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"pivot":{"organization_id":"bible-gateway","bible_id":"GLGSEPT"},"language":{"iso":"glg","glotto_id":"gali1258","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"gl","name":"Galician","autonym":"galego","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Portugal and Spain","area":"Northwest Spain, Galicia Autonomous Region.

The new Common English Bible is the only translation to combine and balance highly respected ecumenical biblical scholarship necessary for serious study with responsiveness to 21st century clear communication requirements for comprehensive clarity.<br>The Common English Bible is the result of collaboration between opposites: scholars working with average readers; conservatives working with liberals; teens working with retirees; men working with women; many denominations and many ethnicities coming together around the common goal of creating a translation that unites rather than divides, with the ultimate goal of mutually accomplishing God’s overall work in the world.<br>Combining scholarly accuracy with vivid language, the Common English Bible is the work of 120 biblical scholars from 24 denominations in American, African, Asian, European, and Latino communities, representing such academic institutions as Asbury Theological Seminary, Azusa Pacific University, Bethel Seminary, Denver Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, Seattle Pacific University, Wheaton College, Yale University, and many others. They meticulously translated the Bible into English directly from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.<br>Additionally, more than 500 readers in 77 groups field-tested the translation. Every verse was read aloud in the reading groups, where potentially confusing passages were identified. The translators considered the groups' responses and, where necessary, reworked those passages to clarify in English their meaning from the original languages. In total, more than 600 people worked jointly to bring the Common English Bible to fruition.<br>In 2010 the New Testament was published.

Royal Greek New Testament","title_vernacular":"Editio Regia","copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":"Editio Regia (Royal edition) is the third and the most important edition of the Greek New Testament of Robert Estienne (1503-1559). It is one of the most important representatives of the Textus Receptus, the first generation of printed editions of the Greek New Testament in history. It was named Editio Regia because of the beautiful and elegant Greek font it uses.<br><br>It was edited by Estienne in 1550 at Paris. It is the first Greek Testament that has a critical apparatus. Estienne entered on the margins of the pages variant readings from 15 Greek manuscripts as well as many readings from the Complutensian Polyglot. He designated all these sources by symbols from α' to ιϛ'. The Complutensian Polyglot was signified by α'. The critical collation was the new subject, and although Estienne omitted hundreds of important variants from used witnesses, it was a significant early step towards textual criticism of the New Testament. The oldest manuscript used in this edition was the Codex Bezae, which had been collated for him, \"by friends in Italy\" (secundo exemplar vetustissimum in Italia ab amicis collatum). The majority of these manuscripts are held in the National Library of France to the present day. Estienne made only a few changes in the Erasmian Novum Testamentum: for example, he added verse Luke 17:36, which he took from Codex Bezae.<br><br>The text of the editions of 1546 (first) and 1549 (second) was a composition of the Complutensian and Erasmian texts. The 1550 (third) edition (the Editio Regia proper) approaches more closely to the Erasmian fourth and fifth editions. According to John Mill, the first and second editions differ in 67 places, and the third in 284 places. The third edition became for many scholars, especially in England, the normative text of the Greek New Testament. It maintained this position until 1880. The 1551 (fourth) edition used exactly the same text as the third, without a critical apparatus, but the text is divided into numbered verses for the first time in the history of the printed text of Greek New Testament. It was used for the Geneva Bible.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-1279-4","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"bible-gateway","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","macroarea":null,"level":"H","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GR","latitude":"39.815500","longitude":"21.912930","population":0,"status_id":"10","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}},{"id":"GRCWHN","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1881","iso":"grc","title":"Westcott-Hort New Testament","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Grek","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"bible-gateway","language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","macroarea":null,"level":"H","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GR","latitude":"39.815500","longitude":"21.912930","population":0,"status_id":"10","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}},{"id":"HATSBH","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1998","iso":"hat","title":"Haitian Creole Bible","title_vernacular":"Kreyòl Ayisyen Haïtienne","copyright":"© Societé Biblique Haïtienne, 1998","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"bible-gateway","language":{"iso":"hat","glotto_id":"hait1244","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"ht","name":"Haitian","autonym":"kreyòl ayisyen","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Creole Languages of the Northern Caribbean","area":"Widespread.
