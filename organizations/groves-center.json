It is dated 1008 CE (or possibly 1009) according to its colophon. The Aleppo Codex, against which the Leningrad Codex was corrected, is several decades older, but parts of it have been missing since 1947, making the Leningrad Codex the oldest complete codex of the Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.\nIn modern times, the Leningrad Codex is significant as the Hebrew text reproduced in Biblia Hebraica (1937), Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (1977), and Biblia Hebraica Quinta (2004–present). It also serves as a primary source for the recovery of details in the missing parts of the Aleppo Codex.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Hebr","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"IL","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-0280-1","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"pivot":{"organization_id":"groves-center","bible_id":"HEBWLC"},"language":{"iso":"hbo","glotto_id":"anci1244","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Ancient Hebrew","autonym":"?????","macroarea":null,"level":"H","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Old Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"IL","latitude":"31.776070","longitude":"35.172480","population":0,"status_id":"9","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}}],"resources":[],"films":[]}
