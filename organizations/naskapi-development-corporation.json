We the Naskapi people have been eager to have our own translation of the Bible. For many decades we have had to make do with Scriptures that were translated for indigenous languages that are different from our own: most notably Bishop Horden's Moose Cree New Testament and prayer book, and Rev. W. G. Walton's prayer book. The Naskapi Development Corporation has been engaged with this work since the 1990s, facilitated by Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Canadian Bible Society. The Naskapi community grateful acknowledges the help of all who participated with us in producing these Scriptures. Our prayer is that these Words of God will be cherished by our people for generations to come.The Naskapi text is copyright © Naskapi Development Corporation Naskapi Development Corporation Kawawachikamach, Québec G0G 2Z0 Canada New Testament published by the Canadian Bible Society (CBS) © 2007 Canadian Bible Society 10 Carnforth Road, Toronto Ontario M4A 2S4 Canada","iso":"nsk","script":"Cans","year":2007,"country_id":"CA","copyright":"© Naskapi Development Corporation"}]}
