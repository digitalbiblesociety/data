The project to produce the Bible was conceived, led, and financed by Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros (circa 1436−1517), who early in the 16th century spearheaded the revitalization of the old University of Alcalá de Henares (founded in 1293) with the establishment of a new university, the Universidad Complutense, in 1508. (Complutense refers to Complutum, the ancient Roman settlement at the site of Alcalá de Henares). With the aid of important figures, such as Antonio de Nebrija, Cardinal Cisneros instituted a new curriculum with a more modern pedagogical orientation. Production of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible was a part of the cardinal’s effort to revive learning and encourage the study of the Holy Scriptures. The book represents the height of Spanish typographic achievement in the 16th century. Although precise information regarding who produced which section is lacking, it is known that around 1503, Cardinal Cisneros, who was surrounded by experts and scholars specializing in a wide array of languages, took on the great task of producing the work. It was a difficult and arduous process that required more than ten years. The printing was done by Arnaldo Guillén de Brocar, a Frenchman who had worked in Pamplona and who opened his main press in Alcalá in 1510. In order to print the book, Brocar had to create new and highly perfected characters for Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. His Greek characters are considered the most beautiful ever carved. The printing was done between 1514 and 1517, but it was not until 1520—after receiving authorization from Rome—that the book was distributed. The Bible consists of separately-bound volumes adding up to 1,500 pages; 600 copies were printed on paper, and six on vellum. Volume one contains the text of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. The upper three-quarters of the pages are divided in three columns that contain the Greek text in the left column; the text of the Latin Vulgate in the middle column; and the Hebrew text in the right column. The lower section of the page is divided into two columns: the left contains the Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch known as the Targum Onkelos, the right the Latin translation of this text. Each page includes an epigraph and apostilles on the right margin. Volumes two and three contain the remainder of the Old Testament, in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Volume four contains the New Testament, in Greek and Latin. The last part of volume four and volume five consist of a Hebrew and Aramaic dictionary, a Hebrew grammar, and a Greek dictionary.

The eschatological content of the Apocalypse made it one of the most popular books among the Russian Old Believers. A version of the Apocalypse with commentary, probably written in the late-sixth century by the Eastern Christian theologian Andrew, Archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, was the most widely read text among the Old Believers. Other versions with commentary by other theologians supplementing that of Andrew of Caesarea also were in circulation. Quite often these annotated manuscripts of the Apocalypse were illustrated with colorful miniatures. Presented here is a splendid example of this type of Apocalypse—an 18th-century manuscript from the collections of the Institute of History of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (II SO RAN) in Novosibirsk, Russia.

The illustrations are the work of an unknown illuminator from the workshop of Johann Bämler (1430–circa 1508). They consist of a colored and golden woodcut initial letter B, containing a scene showing a cardinal and church father, probably Saint Jerome (died 419 or 420), discussing a codex that most likely is Jerome’s translation of the Bible into Latin known as the Vulgate. The text is Jerome’s letter to Paulinus, bishop of Nola, Letter 53, written in 394, which begins: “[Our] Brother Ambrose along with your little gifts has delivered to me a most charming letter….” In the letter Saint Jerome extols Ambrose for his devotion to study of the scriptures and fear of God. The scene is constructed as a perspective view into the interior of a room, with the landscape behind the window topped by a blue sky. The frame of the letter B creates a golden area with stars or rosettes. The upper and internal margins are decorated with flowers and vines. Bämler was a scribe, calligrapher, illuminator, printer, and bookseller. Zainer was a painter and goldsmith who probably was also the first printer in Augsburg.

Presented here is the first American hieroglyphic Bible, A Curious Hieroglyphick Bible, or, Select Passages in the Old and New Testaments, produced in 1788 by the preeminent early American printer and pioneer publisher of children’s literature Isaiah Thomas (1749‒1831). A landmark in 18th-century American book illustration, the Bible contains nearly 500 woodcuts by American artists and is the most ambitious woodcut book produced in America up to that time. In his preface, Thomas offers the book not only as a pleasing method of teaching Bible lessons to children, but as “an easy Way of leading them on in Reading.” Thomas learned the art of engraving while apprenticed in his youth to the Boston printer Zechariah Fowle. Based primarily in Worcester, Massachusetts, Thomas produced 65 children’s books and is widely acclaimed as America’s first enlightened printer of such books, often compared with John Newbery of London, England, with whom he shared the motto, “Instruction with delight.” The book was inscribed by its first owner, “Enoch Brooks’ Book, Princeton, March 13th, 1789.” It is one of four copies of the book known to exist today.

A second volume of the Bible, which was commissioned by Ulrich Stauff zu Ehrenfels (died 1472) and his wife Clara Hofer von Lobenstein, is assumed to have existed but unfortunately has not been preserved. After illuminating the so-called London Bible, his oldest surviving masterpiece, Furtmeyr began decorating what is now known as the Furtmeyr Bible between 1465 and 1470. He did not craft the illuminations all by himself, as they clearly are the work of more than one hand. The artist was assisted by members of his school of illuminators. Furtmeyr and his disciples created three full-page miniatures: one portraying the donators and their family, another of the Virgin Mary breast-feeding Jesus, and a striking “living cross” that comes at the end of the book. The text is illustrated by 355 pictorial fields and 20 initials. The Bible is also remarkable for several nocturnal scenes and a striking predilection for the female nude, characteristic of Renaissance art. The manuscript came into the possession of Duke Albert IV of Bavaria and the Munich Court Library but was carried off in the Swedish invasion of Germany during the Thirty Years War (1618-48). The Furtmeyr Bible finally returned to the successor to its original home, the present-day Bavarian State Library, in 1960.

For the rich decoration of his edition, Anton Koberger (circa 1440‒1513) used the woodcuts made for the Bible printed in Cologne by Bartholomaeus of Unckel in 1478‒79, which he himself had helped to finance. The first woodcut, preceding the book of Genesis, depicts the creation of Eve in Paradise and almost fills an entire page. Unlike Günther Zainer, who had already used woodcut historiated initials in his Bible of 1475‒76, Koberger allowed for painted initials to be supplied by a rubricator or illuminator. Like other copies of this edition, the one shown here was richly illuminated with tempera colors and punched-gold grounds as well as more than 70 initial letters with tempera, gold or silver, and acanthus-leaf decorations to mark the beginning of each biblical book and the apostolic letters. The initials at the beginning of Genesis (folio 5 recto) and Proverbs (folio 296 recto) are particularly lavishly decorated, with busts of the prophets, angels bearing empty crests and animals integrated in the foliate extensions. The painter was trained in the school of Johann Bämler in Augsburg (circa 1435–circa 1503). Miniatures closely resembling those in the Koberger Bible are contained in a manuscript missal dated to 1490 at the Austrian National Library in Vienna. Whether the illuminator worked in Augsburg or in Nuremberg can only be determined after a more extensive investigation of the decoration of incunabula printed by Koberger. At the least, it seems that the copy in the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart was colored and illuminated by a different painter, who very likely worked for Koberger in Nuremberg.

As in the case of the Gutenberg Bible, the German edition contains no information about the printer or the date of printing. However, the analysis of the types used indicates that it was produced in the workshop of Johann Mentelin (circa 1410‒78) in Strasbourg. Furthermore, a handwritten note at the end of this copy provides a decisive clue as to the date of printing (folio 400 verso). Inscribed beneath the coats of arms of the book’s first owners, the Augsburg merchant and councilman Hektor Mülich (died 1489 or 1490) and his wife of patrician lineage, Ottilia Conzelmann (died 1467), a notice records the date and price of purchase: “This book was bought unbound for the price of 12 florins on 27 June 1466.” Its printing therefore must have been completed sometime before that date. As indicated in the inscription, the Bible was purchased unbound. The buyer himself must have arranged for the binding to be done. Prior to binding, the initial letters and captions were rubricated in red, blue, and green, and the book was decorated with painted initials and borders, probably the work of Mülich himself. The purchase of this book indicates that a supra-regional book market already existed in the 1460s, allowing customers in Augsburg to buy books from such far-away places of production as Strasbourg. The German-language Bible was one of the few books possessed by the wealthy Augsburg politician and historian, whose interests focused more on German-language literature than on early Augsburg humanism. Whether this edition of the Bible was really the oldest printed German Bible remained long unresolved, until finally, in 1787, the Munich court librarian Gerhoh Steigenberger was able to prove that another, also undated edition printed in Strasbourg by Heinrich Eggestein was nothing other than an almost-exact reprint of Mentelin’s edition with occasional omissions, thus settling the question of precedence.

Particularly widespread was the 40-leaf Latin version of the Biblia pauperum, which was published in no fewer than 11 block book editions. The arrangement of the text and the sequence of illustrations in the Latin version were adopted by both of the German-language block book editions, which, however, used somewhat simpler woodcuts. The first block book edition in German was co-produced in 1470 in the city of Nördlingen by the painter Friedrich Walther and the carpenter Hans Hurning, as is indicated by a note at the end of the book accompanied by two coats of arms and the date. As early as a year later, the German version was copied by Hans Sporer, a calligrapher and block cutter of Nuremberg, who simplified the illustrations by omitting the hatching and replacing the background landscapes with plain horizontal lines. Imitating the earlier version, Sporer included two coats of arms and the date 1471 in the last plate. The German Biblia pauperum block book presented here certainly does not belong to the first issue produced by Sporer, as this was printed from wooden blocks on which two plates were placed side by side (1–40, 2–39, and so forth). Since the leaves could only be printed on one side, they had to be folded in the middle and arranged in a manner to ensure that the illustrations in the first half of the book were on the left side (verso), while those in the second half were on the right side (recto). At a later stage, Sporer seems to have split the blocks in the middle and begun producing prints with a simple printing press, which allowed printing on both the recto and verso of a leaf, as is the case in the copy shown. Besides the Biblia pauperum, Sporer produced three other block book titles in Nuremberg up to 1474, before he moved to Bamberg and began printing using movable types in 1487.

Leopold was canonized in 1485 and is known as Saint Leopold the Pious. He is the patron saint of Austria. A member of the house of Babenberg, he was born at Gars (present-day Gars am Kamp), near Melk in Lower Austria. The Babenbergs had come to Austria from Bavaria, where the family had risen to prominence in the tenth century, and took possession of the lands along the Danube River between Bavaria and Slovenia. Leopold succeeded his father as margrave of Austria in 1096, when he was 23 years of age. He married Agnes, daughter of Emperor Henry IV and the widow of Frederick of Hohenstaufen, with whom he had 17 children, 11 of whom survived to adulthood.

Only about one-fifth of the miniatures were completed, however, before work was stopped.

Gerung finished the work in 1530–31. In all, this magnificently illuminated Bible contains 146 miniatures and 294 ornamented initials on 307 parchment leaves.

Between 863 and 871 he produced a metrical version of the Gospels or, rather, a Gospel harmony. His work is a “harmonizing” assemblage of selected texts from all four Gospels that tells the story of the life of Christ in southern Rhine Franconian dialect.

Since its return from China in January 1972, the manuscript has been housed at the Central State Archive of Albania. It is considered a unique treasure that belongs to the whole of humanity. In 2005 Codex Beratinus Purpureus Phi and Codex Aureus Anthimi were inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register. The embossed metal plate covers of the manuscript were produced in 1805 and attached to the body, probably during a restoration at that time. The manuscript is in 190 folios on purple parchment, written in Greek majuscule letters of two columns, with 17 lines to the page. The ink is silver and gold, with gold used only for the nomina sacra (sacred names, often abbreviated in Greek manuscripts).

The combination of Saint John with the Raising of Lazarus is one found only in this manuscript. The text was copied by two scribes with distinctly different hands. One of them must have painted the ornament on folio 175 recto, which contains two falcons, a partridge, and a hare. Falcons were trained to chase game, hunting being a favorite pastime of Byzantine noblemen (the sort of people who would commission a luxury manuscript like this one). Folio 59 verso is a full-page miniature inscribed: “The Baptism.” The Holy Spirit is shown descending over Christ in the form of a dove; two angels wait to receive him when he comes out of the water. The vaguely outlined figure on the lower left is a personification of the River Jordan. Saint Mark is seen on folio 60 recto holding an open book with the text of the beginning of his Gospel. In front of him is a writing desk, probably similar to the ones used by Byzantine scribes. The Annunciation is depicted on folio 102 verso. Mary is in the process of spinning purple thread for the curtain of the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem. The Evangelist Luke appears in a half-page miniature on folio 103 recto. The Raising of Lazarus, a full-page miniature on folio 173 verso, shows Lazarus's sisters, Martha and Mary, very small in comparison to Jesus. The man to the left of Lazarus is holding his nose, because the dead body has begun decomposing. Saint John the Theologian is seen in a full-page miniature on folio 174 recto. Unlike the other Evangelists, Saint John is usually shown in Byzantine art as an elderly man. Here he sits at his writing desk, an oil lamp hanging above.

An extremely rare example of the Iberian Hebrew paleography of its time, this manuscript on parchment consists of 451 folios in two columns, each with 31 lines. Profusely illuminated in gold and color with Mozarabic and Jewish motifs, it includes the books of the Old Testament, the Masorah (the body of textual criticism of the Hebrew Scriptures with notes on writing, vocabulary, and variant sources, pronunciation, and other comments), and a grammatical treatise, Sefer Ha-Nikud (The book of vocalization, which is better known as Et Sofer, literally, “The writer’s pen”), written by Rabbi David Kimhi (circa 1160−circa 1235). The scribe who copied the main text, Samuel Ben Abraham ibn Nathan, is identified in the colophon at folio 434 recto. This page also states that the work was executed in Cervera (present-day Lleida Province, Catalonia, Spain); it was begun on July 30, 1299 and completed on May 19, 1300. This colophon also originally included the identity of the patron, which was later erased, probably because of a change of ownership. The identity of the illuminator, Josef Asarfati, a Jew of French origin who settled in Castile, is found in the last folio of the codex, a colophon in zoomorphic letters, making this is a rare example of a Hebrew manuscript containing an explicit signature of the artist. The identity of the Masorah scribe (Josue ben Abraham ibn Gaon) is also known, as his name is inscribed in 20 places in the Masoretic text. The illuminations are spread across many frames and display a remarkable diversity of color and forms. They include ornamental page borders, full-page illuminations representing Jewish iconography, and smaller illuminations illustrating parts of the Old Testament or symbolizing its different books or depicting objects from the Tabernacle used in worship. Some of the illuminations have a largely decorative function (e.g., the hunting scenes and the drolleries). Many of the full-page illuminations are found in the treatise on grammar, where they frame the text with architectural, animal, and human-figure motifs. The Masoretic text is developed in micrographic script, forming geometric schemes and stylized vegetable, animal, and mythic animal motifs. The binding, with cardboard folders covered in red leather and engravings in gold and marbled flyleaves, dates from the 18th century. The manuscript was acquired in 1804, in The Hague, on the initiative of António Ribeiro dos Santos (1745−1818), head librarian of the Royal Public Library of the Court in Lisbon, for the sum of 240,000 reis.

They present a beautiful Sephardic square letter of the biblical text, with Minor Masorah on the margins and between the columns, and Major Masorah in the upper and lower margins, in three and four lines respectively. The text has Tiberian Hebrew punctuation, which greatly resembles that in the best Eastern codices that are examples of this tradition. The parashiyyot (in singular, parashah, annual pericope) are indicated in the margin by means of the abbreviation parash or the letter peh (both decorated). The order of the books of the Bible coincides with the one prescribed in the Babylonian Talmud. In most cases, the Major Masorah is ornamental, especially in the outer margins of the first books of the Pentateuch, and forms micrographs with plant and geometric motifs that in places are reminiscent of large candelabra. This characteristic of the manuscript has given rise to some doubts about its place of origin, since candelabra-shaped micrographs are more common among Catalonian Bibles of the second half of the 14th century. It seems clear, however, that this Bible cannot be associated with the Catalonian school of the 14th century. It is dated to the 13th century, and the style of the candelabra in this manuscript is different from those in Catalonian Bibles. The manuscript reproduces a note concerning proof of purchase that until recently was thought to be the colophon. It states that the Bible was bought by brothers Isaac and Abraham ben Maimón in Toledo in 1280. The manuscript’s Toledan origin seems plausible given the sedarim (singular form, seder, triennial pericope), a typical feature of the Bibles of the Kingdom of Toledo. However, candelabra-shaped micrographs are not found in any other known Toledan manuscript. At the end of the Pentateuch, the Early Prophets, the Latter Prophets, and the Chronicles are exhaustive Masoretic notes that state the total number of the verses and pericopes, as well as the verse, the word, and the medial letter of each book of the Pentateuch, along with other lists with information about the text. The verse recount, which appears at the end of each book of the Bible, generally appears within an ornate vignette (cut off in some cases). The manuscript was part of the collection owned, used, and annotated by the convert Alfonso de Zamora (circa 1474–circa 1544), teacher of Hebrew in Salamanca and Alcalá de Henares. Evidence for his ownership is apparent in his characteristic way of numbering chapters or naming the books of the Bible, for example. The manuscript is also known to be the one used extensively for the composition of the Hebrew text of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible of 1514. It has a Complutense (of Alcalá de Henares) cloth binding from the 16th century and bears the golden coat of arms of the Complutense University of Madrid.

It contains two separate units, a calendar and the oldest Book of Gospels in the Hungarian language. The latter is part of the so-called Hussite Bible, the only written vestige of Hussitism in Hungary. The translation is thought to have been produced by two Hungarian divines, Tamás Pécsi (Thomas de Quinque Ecclesiis) and Bálint Újlaki (Valentinus de Ilok), who as students in Prague (then in Bohemia) had come under the influence of the teachings of Jan Hus (circa 1369‒1415). The original manuscript of the Hussite Bible has not come down to us; only partial copies have survived. The principal exemplars are, apart from the Codex of Munich, the Codex of Vienna (excerpts from the Old Testament, preserved by the National Széchényi Library in Budapest), and the Apor Codex (translation of the 150 Psalms, owned by the Székely National Museum in Sfântu Gheorghe, Romania). The Munich manuscript was written by György Németi in Târgu Trotus (Moldavia) in 1466. It consists of 124 pages and contains the four Gospels, with the beginning of each Gospel decorated with an ornamental border. The codex is famous both for the text, but also as a literary monument, as Pécsi and Újlaki for the first time adopted the orthographic system of writing special sounds with diacritic marks. It is unknown where the codex went after its completion. It came to the newly founded Munich court library, today’s Bavarian State Library, together with the library of Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter (circa 1506‒57) in 1558. It is quite probable that Widmanstetter received the book in his position as chancellor at the Viennese court from Tamás Nádasdy, the representative of the Hungarian king in the early 1550s.

It was written in 1278 by Archbishop Johannes, the brother of King Lewon III (also seen as Leon, 1270‒89) and abbot of the monastery in Grner in the kingdom of Cilician Armenia (which existed from 1080 to 1375). An artist named Basilius made the illuminations, and the binder was Arrakhel Hnasandentz, as is stated in a note in the book. The manuscript follows the usual pattern of Armenian texts of the four Gospels: the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, decked out with tailpieces, is followed by the Canon tables (here unfortunately without the usual artistic embellishments); then come the texts of the four Gospels, each introduced by a table of contents of the chapters and a prologue, a picture of the Evangelist covering the whole of the left-hand page, and a richly decorated first page of the Gospel covering the right-hand page. At the bottom of the pages are found details relating to individual canons of Eusebius, a method which served to facilitate the subdivision of the Gospels prior to the introduction of chapters and verses. The translation of the Gospels into Armenian is amongst the oldest examples of Armenian literature, and was an achievement of the Armenian Golden Age of around 400 to 450. The miniatures in the manuscript were executed during the best period of Armenian illumination, which reached its peak in Cilician Armenia with the artist T’oros Roslin in the mid-13th century. Together with the library of Johann Jakob Fugger, this manuscript has been part of the library of the dukes of Bavaria and hence of today's Bavarian State Library since 1571.

There are some marginal pen-drawn decorations and later written marginalia. The manuscript has one marginal miniature—that of an infant. The original incised leather binding is in damaged condition. Colophons throughout indicate the history of the manuscript, which at the turn of the 20th century was in the hands of the Library of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. The Bible was first translated into Armenian in the early fifth century, shortly after the invention of the Armenian alphabet between 407 and 412. The history of the translation of the Armenian Bible is complicated. By tradition it has been ascribed to Mesrob Mashtots (circa 361‒440), the creator of the Armenian alphabet, and Isaac (Sahak) the Catholicos (died 439) and their assistants. The work was completed before the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431. This manuscript is an awetaran, the copying of the four gospels alone, which was a very popular genre among the Armenians.

John was called Chrysostom (“Golden Mouth”) because of his great eloquence. Along with Athanasius of Alexandria, Basil the Great, and Gregory of Nazianzus, he is counted as one of the Four Great Eastern (or Greek) doctors of the Ancient Church, and thus is highly venerated by the Armenian Church. He wrote his Commentaries on the Psalms between 386 and 398.

The exact location of the monastery is unknown, although, since the late 1980s, it has been associated with the ruins of the Monastery of Arates (Aratesivank) of Siwnik. Verin Noravank was in close contact with the better-known Noravank of Amaghu, with which it has often been confused. Fewer than 15 manuscripts are known to have been copied at Verin Noravank. As was customary with most Armenian manuscripts, the Verin Noravank gospel contains a lengthy colophon that traces its own history. The colophon is also important because it contains one of the few references to the White Sheep Turkoman overlord of that region at the time, Yaqub Bek. The four miniatures of the Evangelists and the decorative illuminations in the text are striking features of the gospel book, which was acquired by the Library of Congress in 2008. Technical analysis of the illuminations has revealed that the artist used a number of rare pigments, including tin white (tin oxide, SnO2); a blue-pigment mixture of cobalt glass (smalt), ultramarine, and possibly indigo; and a mixed red lead-vermillion pigment. The use of these pigments suggests ingenuity on the part of the artist, as well as the influence of Near Eastern and indigenous ceramic and textile technologies.

This influence is also visible in the large woodcuts, where the styles of the artists Donatello, Alessandro Botticelli, and Domenico Ghirlandaio can be identified.

Block book printing emerged in the 15th century and was used to produce Bible tales and moral stories for a semi-literate population in much the same fashion as stained glass windows in churches depicted stories from the life of Christ and the saints.

The Gospels, written by the four evangelists, provide slightly different accounts of the life of Christ, with some events recorded in only one Gospel and others in more than one. Early Christian writers composed works that aimed to harmonize the different accounts and show there were no contradictions between them. Augustine took for granted that the order in which the Gospels appeared in the New Testament was the order in which they were composed, and that the writers of each of the Gospels had knowledge of the ones already written. Matthew was the original account of Jesus’s life on earth, and the writers of the other Gospels either added or reworked content to emphasize different aspects of Christ’s life and the Incarnation. The work is organized in four books: “Authority, number, order, and plan of the Gospels.

It was produced around the year 750 in the south of England, probably at Canterbury. The manuscript was written on alternate purple and uncolored leaves in uncial script in black, red, white, gold, and silver inks. Two of the four full-page portraits of the Evangelists have survived, made in Anglo-Saxon style with strong Byzantine and Italian elements. The uncial script, arranged on certain pages in patterns known as carmina figurata (figure poems), the miniatures of the Evangelists, and the use of purple parchment all emulate the splendor of imperial manuscripts from late antiquity. Three of the leaves are mutilated; half or the major part of each has been cut away, but without any missing text. The manuscript originally had at least a further five, and probably more, leaves. One endleaf is at the front, added perhaps after medieval times; the back endleaf is missing. According to an Anglo-Saxon inscription from the ninth century, the Codex Aureus was carried off by Vikings during a raid, but about a century later it was restored to Christ Church Cathedral in Canterbury. It is presumed that the codex subsequently remained at Canterbury Cathedral throughout the Middle Ages.

Sparwenfeld donated the Codex Aureus to the Royal Library (National Library of Sweden) in 1705.

Heiric, a Benedictine theologian and writer, was a monk at the Abbey of Saint-Germain d’Auxerre. He studied under Lupus of Ferrière, John Scotus Erigena, and Haymo of Auxerre. He was the teacher of Remigius of Auxerre and is an important representative of intellectual life in the Carolingian period. The manuscript was written, by at least three scribes, in dark-brown ink in a fine Caroline minuscule script. On the basis of the script, which resembles that of manuscript BAV, Reg. Lat. 215 (in the Vatican Apostolic Library) ascribed to Tours and dated after 877 and the scripts of another manuscript in the Bergendal Collection, also done in Tours circa 1025, it is fairly certain that this codex was prepared in the scriptorium of the Abbey of Saint Martin in Tours circa 950. This scriptorium was founded around 795 by Alcuin of York (735–804). On the basis of marginal notations, it can be concluded that the manuscript likely was once in the possession of the Abbey of Saint Julian in Tours. It later belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792–1872), an Englishman who was an important book and manuscript collector.

A dedicatory poem and a full-page miniature, in which Henry and his wife Cunegunda (also seen as Kunigunde) are crowned by Christ, commemorate the royal donor, who was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1014 and later was canonized. The generously proportioned manuscript, with its wide margins, combines great care in execution with extraordinary artistic power. In the boldly expressive figures with their imperious gestures, Reichenau illumination attains the sublime. For the binding, precious materials were provided by the emperor, who is again named in an inscription. The Crucifixion ivory from the time of Charles the Bald may possibly have come from the back cover of the Codex aureus, a ninth century Gospel written for Charles the Bald and preserved in the monastery of Saint Emmeram. The Byzantine enamels of Christ and the Apostles are pieces of a woman’s or votive crown, which may well have come from the heritage of Holy Roman Emperor Otto III (980–1002), as was the case with many a precious codex. The delicate cloisonné enamels with Evangelists’ symbols in the corners were, like the rest of the gold work, made specifically for the cover. This cover was produced in Regensburg or Bamberg, and not in Reichenau. In 2003 the manuscript was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

Honorius follows the allegorical interpretation of the marriage of Christ and his Church, depicted in the title piece. In books two to four, the allegorical marriage is followed through four epochs: ante legem (before the law), represented by the daughter of Pharaoh; sub lege (under the law), represented by the daughter of Babylon; sub gratia (under grace), represented by Sunamitis (i.e., the unnamed Shulamite woman to whom Solomon professes his love in the Song of Songs); and sub antichristo (under the anti-Christ), represented by Mandragora. In accordance with Honorius's text, the bride appears in dual form: as Ecclesia (the Church) in the New Jerusalem, and as a personification of the Church remaining in this world, which embodies all mankind. Honorius was a theologian and philosopher who was active in southern Germany in the first third of the 12th century.

It is likely that the codex was a wedding gift of King Edward II of England (1284–1327) to his wife Isabella of France (1292/96–1358), presented in 1303–8. The initial to Psalm 119 shows a queen, most likely Isabella herself, kneeling between the coats of arms of England and France. Written for the diocese of York, probably in the workshop of the Augustinian priory near Nottingham (as revealed by the calendar), the psalter was illuminated by the workshop of the Tickhill Psalter (preserved in the New York Public Library, Spencer 26). Both psalters are among the most richly illuminated English psalters of the 14th century. The Isabella Psalter features three independent cycles of illumination with scenes from the Old Testament. The first shows views of the Creation. The second is a cycle of the life of King David, with special scenes relevant to a queen, including a wedding and the hiding of the king. A third cycle, in the bas-de-page of the Anglo-Norman version of the psalter, shows scenes and animals of a bestiary, largely based on the Physiologus (a popular medieval bestiary, derived from an earlier Greek source), while the initials of the Anglo-Norman text show coats of arms, mostly of English knights. The Isabella Psalter remained in England up until the 17th century or early 18th century. It was in the library of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (1756–1825, king of Bavaria 1806–25) and subsequently became part of the present-day Bavarian State Library.

The codex had been commissioned for the daily psalms to be sung in the church choir. The initials and fleuronée ornamentation are today ascribed to Conrad Wagner, a conventual of Saint Ulrich and Afra. In addition, the Augsburg book painter Georg Beck (1450-1512) was involved in the production, in charge, together with his son, of the illuminations. Beck’s son is identified as the painter Leonhard Beck (circa 1480‒1542), who has been repeatedly verified as a miniaturist. Consistent with its intended use in the monastic choral prayer of the Benedictine monks, antiphons or invitatoria, responsories, ferial hymns, and verses are, in their biblical order, interposed in the psalms, thus constituting a so-called psalterium feriatum. The Psalter is preceded by benedictions, absolutions, and a calendar. The text follows the version of the Septuagint, the Greek Bible; only the psalm titles, i.e., the biblical “headlines,” quote mostly the translation of the Psalter iuxta Hebraeos, being a direct translation by Saint Jerome from Hebrew. The manuscript contains, for the purpose of the monastic division of the psalter as well as for highlighted canticles and sequences of hymns, a total of 35 historiated initials with solid colored backgrounds and images from the life of David, who was then regarded as the author of the psalms and to whom many of the headlines relate. The iconographic peculiarities of this manuscript include, in the context of Psalm 52, the drinking fools, who are bowling and playing dice, as well as the depiction of the Good Shepherd, the latter in connection with Psalm 79. The image of the monk and Death, found within the Office of the Dead on leaf 177 recto, is remarkable. The Psalter even uses images from incunabula, including the woodblock print of all saints, taken from Günther Zainer’s Heiligenleben (Life of the saints) and the works of art by Martin Schongauer or Israhel van Meckenem (Judith with the Head of Holofernes, among other works). In the course of the secularization of the monasteries in Bavaria the manuscript was transferred, in January 1807, from Saint Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg to the court and state library in Munich, now the Bavarian State Library.

The calendar pages resembling a diptych include in the tympanum, in the upper left, the signs of the zodiac, and, in the upper-right field the monthly activities. Below in the left column is the calendar text; in the right column are the twelve apostles. The psalter section is initiated by a full-page initial “B” for Beatus vir (Blessed is the man). In the lower arch of the \"B\" King David is shown with the harp; in the upper arch Christ is depicted as the Man of Sorrows. Opposite is an ornamental text page with the beginning of the first psalm in golden capital letters. Additional historiated initials comprising nine or even ten lines appear in each of the divisions of the tenths of the psalter. The illustrations contained therein are complementary to the full-page miniatures on the opposite page, both constituting a cycle of the life of Jesus. On the second of the miniatures, to Psalm 38, the Presentation in the Temple is shown, while the opposing initial depicts the baptism of Jesus. The cycle spans the scourging, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, and Pentecost, up to Maiestas Domini (Christ in Majesty) in Psalm 109, followed by an initial with the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. In the litany are found miniatures of saints. According to a note by Johann Friedrich Hekel on the first leaf, the manuscript originally came from the Bibliotheca Palatina in Heidelberg. Hekel himself, who died in 1700, had purchased it from a rabbi in Frankfurt. The psalter thus seems to have been lost before the Heidelberg library was transferred to Rome in 1622. When and in what way the codex came into the Munich Court Library, the present-day Bavarian State Library, is unknown.

Mainz was the archiepiscopal seat of Saint Boniface (circa 680–754), the English-born “Apostle of the Germans” and the first archbishop of Mainz, while the Benedictine monastery of Hersfeld was founded by two of Boniface's disciples.

The incunabulum is almost complete (it is missing the first, second, and last pages) and represents the only copy of this edition in Romanian collections. Its rarity is increased by the post-printer decorations made manually on the fourth surviving page, on which the frame and initials are illuminated in three colors and gold. The text is in black, with red and blue capitals at chapter openers, and there are black ink annotations. The print details are given on folio 422 verso at the end of the Bible, before the Hebrew names. Ottaviano Scotto, originally from Monza near Milan, was living in Venice by 1479. He printed books in Latin, including some for the Dominicans, but is best known for the important role he later played in the printing of sheet music. His nephews continued the business after his death in 1498. The Scotto firm became one of the most significant music printers and publishers in Venice.

These richly illustrated codices were in most cases commissioned by high-ranking persons. This manuscript was made for Emperor Henry II (ruled, 1002–1024), the successor of Otto III, who presented it to the Bamberg Cathedral. The gold cover is one of the most beautiful examples of Ottonian book binding. The principal theme of medieval bindings—the Glorification of Christ—is represented by gold work of extraordinary artistry. The cross of triumph, with a large oval agate at its center, dominates the composition. The introductory picture shows Christ, as victor and source of life, in the Tree of Life, surrounded by the symbols of the evangelists. In the lunettes of the evangelists, the symbol of each evangelist is linked with one of the major events of salvation. The iconography of the manuscript, with its rich and unusual array of references, is unique in Reichenau illumination.

The collection was structured according to certain principles derived from Raphael’s theories of art. The binding of this book is much simpler than the well-known Roman bindings from the Albani library and, on closer inspection, the drawings also prove to be copies of engravings by Schiaminossi, crafted by a German artist.

In 1572, he moved to Lviv. The Apostle was among the most widely used liturgical books of the Orthodox Church.

The marvelous manuscript, written during the episcopate of Anno of Freising (854–75), has in the margins of its leaves numerous critical notes on the text, including a series of Greek variants. Other influences can be observed in the decoration, which consists of interlace initials, an 18-page canon sequence, and four pictures of the evangelists. The influence of the Carolingian school of Rheims is directly discernible in the agitated painting style of the portraits of the evangelists. The ornamental decoration of the manuscript is likewise characterized as being permeated by various artistic traditions. In a group of related Freising gospel manuscripts, this codex comes first both in time and in quality. Carolingian refers to the period in which much of Western Europe was ruled by the dynasty established by Pepin the Short in 751, whose son, Charlemagne, was crowned Holy Roman emperor in 800 and ruled the empire until his death in 814. The Carolingian Renaissance of about 775–900 was marked by achievements in art, architecture, literature, religion, and law.

The earliest translations of parts of the Bible into Pushto were completed in the first decade of the 19th century by John Leyden, a Scottish linguist and poet who went to Calcutta in 1803 as a surgeon’s assistant for the East India Company and subsequently became a professor at the College of Fort William. By the time of his death in 1811, Leyden had completed translations of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark. Leyden’s Pushto speaking co-workers completed the entire New Testament by 1818. Large parts of the Hebrew scriptures were translated between 1822 and 1832 by a group led by William Carey. Several other translations were begun and partially completed later in the century. The version of the Gospel of John presented here is a revision of earlier translations undertaken in the 1930s by the American-Danish Protestant missionary Jens Christensen (1899‒1966), with the assistance of M.K. Taib. Christensen was born in Chicago to Danish parents. After service as a soldier at the front in World War I, Christensen decided to become a missionary. Following study at the New York Missionary Training School in Nyack, New York, in 1925 Christensen joined the Danish Mission in Mardan, North-West Frontier Province, British India. In addition to his pastoral work, Christensen wrote several books on the Pathans and Islam and completed new translations of the Gospels of Matthew and John. His collaborator, Taib, was a Muslim convert from a village in Swat who was also a writer, poet, and the librarian of the Mardan mission. Taib versified the translation to make it more palatable to Pathan tastes. The volume presented here, from the Africa and Middle East Division of the Library of Congress, is quite rare.

Like the biblical texts, they are equally loose paraphrases of their Latin originals. The other Old Testament books in the manuscript were translated in the late 14th century (circa 1500): Joshua and Judges by Nicolaus Ragvaldi (died 1514), the confessor general at Vadstena monastery in Sweden, and Esther, Ruth, Judith, and Maccabees by Jöns Budde (circa 1437‒91), a monk at the Birgittine monastery of Nådendal in Finland. The translator of the Book of Revelation is unknown. The manuscript is the first known translation into Swedish of the Bible or a large part of the Bible. The colophon states that it was produced at the expense of the Vadstena nun Ingegärd, daughter to Torsten Bowastason. Ingegärd’s mother donated the parchment and an anonymous Vadstena nun was the scribe. She asks in the colophon to be remembered by readers in their prayers.

This Syriac type was produced by Kaspar Kraft under the direction of the French Orientalist Guillaume Postel (1510-1581). This edition of the New Testament has James, 1 Peter, and 1 John, but not the other General Epistles or Revelation. Several woodcuts with Hapsburg motifs and Syriac and Latin inscriptions ornament the book, and facing the beginning of the Gospel of John is a unique woodcut of the crucifixion and the Kabbalistic Sephirot. The book had a liturgical aim, as is reflected in the table in Syriac and Latin of lectionary readings that concludes the work.
