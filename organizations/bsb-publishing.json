The Bishop’s Bible, published in the same year of the schism, sought to reconcile the nation’s variety of Protestant convictions into one Bible and was. Consequently, it was almost universally panned. David Daniel the preface to his seminal edition of the William Tyndale New Testament, says that the Bishops' Bible \"was, and is, not loved. Where it reprints Geneva it is acceptable, but most of the original work is incompetent, both in its scholarship and its verbosity.\" After a period of heavy revision, it was supplanted by the King James Bible in 1611.","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":1568,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"Public Domain","copyright_type":"OPEN"}]}
