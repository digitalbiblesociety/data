The first written instances of the dialect occurred around 300 A.D., including translations of Biblical texts. The spelling of written Sahidic became standardized by the 6th century, and almost all native Coptic authors wrote in the dialect. Whereas texts in other Coptic dialects are usually translations of other Greek works, the Sahidic dialect is the only one with a large body of original literature and non-literary texts. And since Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic, has few peculiarities not shared with other dialects, and has a considerable corpus of known texts, it is usually the dialect studied by students of Coptic.\nWhen George Horner prepared his critical editions of the Coptic text in the early 1900’s, he also prepared translations of the Sahidic and Bohairic versions for the edition.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Copt","versification":"Coptic","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"EG","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-0165-1","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"pivot":{"organization_id":"oxford-the-clarendon-press","bible_id":"COPSNT"},"language":{"iso":"cop","glotto_id":"copt1239","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Coptic","autonym":"ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ ~ ⲧⲙⲛ̄ⲧⲣⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲕⲏⲙⲉ","macroarea":null,"level":"E","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"EG","latitude":"29.472030","longitude":"31.205300","population":0,"status_id":"9","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}},{"id":"ENGKJV400","parent_bible_id":"ENGKJV","gbc":null,"date":"1611","iso":"eng","title":"King James Authorised 400th Anniversary Edition","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"This 400th anniversary edition of the King James Version of the Bible is a reprint of the 1611 text, in an easy-to-read roman font instead of the black-letter type of the original.
