Tumbuka belongs to the same language group (Guthrie Zone N) as Chewa and Sena.\n\nTwo systems of writing Tumbuka are in use: the traditional spelling (used for example in the Chitumbuka version of Wikipedia and in the newspaper Fuko), in which words such as banthu 'people' and chaka 'year' are written with 'b' and 'ch', and the new official spelling (used for example in the Citumbuka dictionary published online by the Centre for Language Studies and in the online Bible), in which the same words are written with 'ŵ' and 'c', e.g. ŵanthu and caka. (The sound 'ŵ' is a closely rounded [w] pronounced with the tongue in the close-i position.) There is some uncertainty over where to write 'r' and where 'l', e.g. cakulya (Dictionary) or cakurya (Bible) 'food'. (In fact [l] and [r] are allophones of the same phoneme.) There is also hesitation between the spellings 'sk' and 'sy' (both miskombe and misyombe ('bamboo') are found in the Citumbuka dictionary).","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"pivot":{"organization_id":"bible-society-of-malawi","bible_id":"TUMNEW"},"language":{"iso":"tum","glotto_id":"tumb1250","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Tumbuka","autonym":"Chitumbuka","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Malawi","area":"Northern Province, west shore of Lake Malawi, south of the Ngonde, north of the Tonga and Ngoni.
