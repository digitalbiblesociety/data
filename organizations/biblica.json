The New Living Translation is based on the most recent scholarship in the theory of translation. The challenge for the translators was to create a text that would make the same impact in the life of modern readers that the original text had for the original readers. In the New Living Translation, this is accomplished by translating entire thoughts (rather than just words) into natural, everyday English. The end result is a translation that is easy to read and understand and that accurately communicates the meaning of the original text.<br>Copyright © 1996, 2004, 2007 by Tyndale House Foundation.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"biblica","language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}},{"id":"HAUSRK","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2020","iso":"hau","title":"Biblica® Open Hausa Contemporary Bible™","title_vernacular":"Sabon Rai Don Kowa","copyright":"© 2020 Biblica","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"CCBYSA","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"biblica","language":{"iso":"hau","glotto_id":"haus1257","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"ha","name":"Hausa","autonym":" هَرْشَن هَوْسَ","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Burkina Faso","area":"Sokoto, Kaduna, Katsina, Kano, Bauchi, Jigawa, Zamfara, Kebbi, and Gombe states.
