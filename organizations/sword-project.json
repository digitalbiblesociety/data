This Bible helps us understand God's love for everyone and after-life destinies. What is an un-translation? This Bible shows the locations of ten key Greek and Hebrew words. The primary word shown is aionios, typically translated eternal, yet aionios means something more wonderful than infinite time! Greeks used aionios to mean entirety, even consummate, but never merely infinite time. So the aionios life promised in John 3:16 is not simply a ticket to future eternal life, but the invitation to consummate life now! Aionios life with Christ is better than forever. This Bible is in the Norwegian Nynorsk language, with source: Students Language Association (Studentmållaget), Seippel, Hognestad, Indrebø, year 1921, from Crosswire.org, free at AionianBible.org, and also known as The Purple Bible. Apocryphal text is removed and verses renumbered to the English standard.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"sword-project","language":{"iso":"nor","glotto_id":"norw1258","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"no","name":"Norwegian","autonym":"norsk","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden","area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"NO","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"population":5305910,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}}],"resources":[],"films":[]}
