In 1986. the Rev. Alberto Rossa noticed that his parishioners who spoke English as a second language struggled to read the more popular English translations of the Bible. With the help of Greek and Hebrew scholars, Rossa produced a Catholic Pastoral Bible in 1988 that would allow his parishioners access to the scriptures. The introduction contains a forward from Rossa in which he explains that the Bible is full of mystery and that the new reader should not be discouraged if they do not understand everything at once.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"pivot":{"organization_id":"claretian-publications","bible_id":"ENGCCB"},"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null}}],"resources":[],"films":[]}
