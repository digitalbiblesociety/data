After being joined by two other Baptist missionaries in 1799 he moved to the Danish colony of Serampore, where missionaries were looked upon more kindly than in those parts of India where the East India Company held sway. Carey and his companions established a printing press there and baptised their first Hindu convert to Christianity, Krishna Pal, in the following year.<br>In 1800 Carey produced a translation of the Gospel of Matthew into Bengali in an edition of 500 copies. By the following year he had completed the translation of the entire New Testament into that language and it was printed in an edition of 2,000 copies.<br>The translation of the Old Testament followed in 1809. Carey was a prolific translator and an able linguist; by the time of his death he had translated the Bible or portions of it into 34 different Asian languages and dialects, including Chinese, Hindi and Gujarati, and 200,000 individual copies of Biblical works had rolled off the presses of the Serampore Mission Press.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Beng","versification":"Bengali","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"IN","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-1054-7","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"laravel_through_key":"bible-society-of-bangladesh","language":{"iso":"ben","glotto_id":"beng1280","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"bn","name":"Bengali","autonym":"বাংলা","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Bangladesh","area":"West.
