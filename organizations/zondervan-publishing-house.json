Today it is more widely known as the Modern Language Bible. The translators and publishers stated goal was to create a plain English translation of the Bible that communicated, as accurately as possible, the original meaning of the text. To quote the editor-in-chief of the project, Gerrit Verkuyl, â€œThe conviction that God wants His truth conveyed to His offspring in the language in which they think and live led me to produce the Berkeley Version (BV) of the New Testament.
