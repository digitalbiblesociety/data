Singapore subsequently became one of the world's most prosperous countries with strong international trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of tonnage handled) and with per capita GDP equal to that of the leading nations of Western Europe.",
        "overview": "'Singapore an island city-state off southern Malaysia is a global financial center with a tropical climate and multicultural population. Its colonial core centers on the Padang a cricket field since the 1830s and now flanked by grand buildings such as City Hall with its 18 Corinthian columns. In Singapore''s circa-1820 Chinatown stands the red-and-gold Buddha Tooth Relic Temple said to house one of Buddha''s teeth.'",
