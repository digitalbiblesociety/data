            "description": "The point of the Free Bible Version NT is to present the scriptures as competently and beautifully as possible without the hindrances of modern copyright law. Today, most Bible translators limit the number of verses that can be used or who can print their Bibles, sometime hitting non-profit distributors with huge fees. The translators of FBV want to give readers a Bible that they can use without fear of being sued. So long as users don’t change the actual words of the text, they can use it in any way they like.",

        "introduction": "Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states and the Great Depression of the 1930s an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991 the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II the economy has achieved relatively steady growth low unemployment and inflation and rapid advances in technology.",
