Today, most Bible translators limit the number of verses that can be used or who can print their Bibles, sometime hitting non-profit distributors with huge fees. The translators of FBV want to give readers a Bible that they can use without fear of being sued. So long as users don’t change the actual words of the text, they can use it in any way they like.","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":2018,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"Dr. Jonathan Gallagher"},{"abbr":"SPAVBL","title":"Spanish Free Bible Version","title_vernacular":"Versión Biblia Libre","description":"The New Testament in Spanish, Free Bible Version","iso":"spa","script":"Latn","year":2018,"country_id":"ES","copyright":"© 2018 Jonathan Gallagher y Shelly Barrios de Avila","copyright_type":"CCBYND"}]}
