The population of the island continues to drop (from a peak of 5200 in 1966 to an estimated 1190 in 2014) with substantial emigration to New Zealand 2400 km to the southwest.","overview":"'Niue is a small island nation in the South Pacific Ocean. It’s known for its limestone cliffs and coral-reef dive sites. Migrating whales swim in Niue''s waters between July and October. In the southeast is the Huvalu Forest Conservation Area where trails through fossilized coral forests lead to the Togo and Vaikona chasms. The northwest is home to the rock pools of Avaiki Cave and the naturally formed Talava Arches.'","landmass_km":260,"population_year_change":0.68,"population_density_km":6,"population_urban_percentage":46,"population_literacy_percentage":99,"region_code":1,"region_id":61,"region_name":"Polynesia","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niue","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/niue/","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Oceania/Niue","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/NU"}}
