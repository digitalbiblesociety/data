Beck was too long or impenetrable, the so-called “Beck’s American Translation” proved a more accessible alternative.  This abbreviation of the longer Bible also published by William F. Beck in cooperation with the Lutheran Church’s Missouri Synod and Concordia Publishing House first appeared in 1963, and though it is no longer considered a mainstream translation fo the Bible, it continues to have faithful and regular readers. This version contains a preface written by Herman Otten.",
