{"abbr":"ENGTHB","title":"Tanach Hebrew Bible Leeser","description":"Isaac Leeser (1806-1868) played a formative role in American Judaism. Leeser wanted to strengthen the Jewish community in its traditions so it would not be assimilated by Protestant America. Many Jews of that day did not read Hebrew and were reading the King James Bible. Leeser believed Jews should have their own translation of the Scriptures, free from Christian interpretation. He spent fifteen years, in the midst of many other projects, preparing his Bible translation “after the best Jewish authorities.” Bertram Korn summarized Leeser’s accomplishments for American Judaism: “Practically every form of Jewish activity which supports American Jewish life today was either established or envisaged by this one man. Almost every kind of publication which is essential to Jewish survival was written, translated, or fostered by him.”","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":1853,"country_id":"US","copyright":"Public Domain","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGTHB","url":"https://archive.org/download/ENGTHB_DBS_HS/English-(1853)-Tanach-Hebrew-Bible-(Leeser).pdf","title":"English (1853) Tanach Hebrew Bible (Leeser)","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"124204258","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"}],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000},"country":{"id":"US","name":"United States","name_long":"The United States of America","population":334998398,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"USA","continent_id":"NA","iso_num":840,"language_count":506,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states and the Great Depression of the 1930s an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991 the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II the economy has achieved relatively steady growth low unemployment and inflation and rapid advances in technology.","overview":"'The U.S. is a country of 50 states covering a vast swath of North America with Alaska in the northwest and Hawaii extending the nation’s presence into the Pacific Ocean.
