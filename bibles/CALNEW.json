Negotiations for territorial status began in 1972. A covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the US was approved in 1975 and came into force on 24 March 1976. A new government and constitution went into effect in 1978.","overview":"'The Northern Mariana Islands are a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean.
