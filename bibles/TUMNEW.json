It is also known as Chitumbuka or Citumbuka — the chi- prefix in front of Tumbuka means \"the language of the\", and is understood in this case to mean \"the language of (the Tumbuka people)\". Tumbuka belongs to the same language group (Guthrie Zone N) as Chewa and Sena.\n\nTwo systems of writing Tumbuka are in use: the traditional spelling (used for example in the Chitumbuka version of Wikipedia and in the newspaper Fuko), in which words such as banthu 'people' and chaka 'year' are written with 'b' and 'ch', and the new official spelling (used for example in the Citumbuka dictionary published online by the Centre for Language Studies and in the online Bible), in which the same words are written with 'ŵ' and 'c', e.g. ŵanthu and caka. (The sound 'ŵ' is a closely rounded [w] pronounced with the tongue in the close-i position.) There is some uncertainty over where to write 'r' and where 'l', e.g. cakulya (Dictionary) or cakurya (Bible) 'food'. (In fact [l] and [r] are allophones of the same phoneme.) There is also hesitation between the spellings 'sk' and 'sy' (both miskombe and misyombe ('bamboo') are found in the Citumbuka dictionary).","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"TUMNEW","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/1961-tumbuka-new-tumbuka-bible","title":"New Tumbuka Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Bible Society of Malawi","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"TUMNEW","bible_size_id":"FB","bible_link_type":"archive","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=388e07e45913a9ba","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":null,"type":"archive","provider":"Digital Bible Library","organization_id":"digital-bible-library","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"TUMNEW","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"genesis","url":"http://downloads.dbs.org/archive/Tumbuka-Genesis-Portion-(Mazgu-Ya-Ciuta).pdf","title":"Tumbuka - Genesis Portion","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Societies in Zambia and Malawi","organization_id":"united-bible-societies","filesize":336910,"response_code":null}],"pod":[],"alphabet":{"script":"Latn","name":"Latin","unicode_pdf":null,"family":"European","type":"alphabet","white_space":"between words","open_type_tag":"latn","complex_positioning":"yes","requires_font":false,"unicode":true,"diacritics":true,"contextual_forms":false,"reordering":false,"case":null,"split_graphs":false,"status":"Current","baseline":"bottom","ligatures":"optional","direction":"ltr","direction_notes":null,"sample":null,"sample_img":null,"description":"<p>The Latin script (also called the Roman script) is the most widely used writing system in the world, being the script of the English language, spoken by over 300,000,000 people worldwide. It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"tum","glotto_id":"tumb1250","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Tumbuka","autonym":"Chitumbuka","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Malawi","area":"Northern Province, west shore of Lake Malawi, south of the Ngonde, north of the Tonga and Ngoni.
