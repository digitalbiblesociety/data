He is remembered for his book Harmony of the Gospels and as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1769.<br><br>James Macknight was a minister in the Church of Scotland in the eighteenth century. His commentary on the apostolic epistles, originally published in 1795, is his most enduring work. The result of 30 years of tireless study, this extensive commentary covers the New Testament epistles from Romans to Jude. The English biographer and churchman T. F. Dibdin said of Macknight’s commentary, “in these [the reader] will find learning without pedantry. . . . no theological collection can be perfect without them.”",
