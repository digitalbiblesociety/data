{"abbr":"HEBHEPT","title":"Lexicon Heptaglotton","title_vernacular":"Lexicon Heptaglotton, Hebraicum","description":"Lexicon heptaglotton, Hebraicum Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, AEthiopicum, Arabicum, conjunctim : et Persicum, separatim... Cui accessit brevis, \u0026 harmonica... grammaticae omnium praecedentium linguarum delineatio / Authore Edmundo Castello (Castell).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCastell devoted 18 years of his life to his great Lexicon, “filled with unremitting toil of seldom less than 16 or 18 hours a day, with constant vigils, with bodily suffering, with loss of fortune, and finally all but the loss of sight” (DNB). The Lexicon grew out of Castell’s work in assisting Brian Walton in the preparation of his renowned Biblia Polyglotta, “in which Castell was especially responsible for the Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, as Walton himself admits; though it appears that Castell was credited by Walton with a much smaller share in the work than he really accomplished. While the Lexicon’s appearance “marks an epoch in Semitic scholarship” (DNB), it was never destined to be a popular work. At the time of Castell’s death about 500 copies remained unsold; these were put in storage, but carelessly, “where for some years the rats played such havoc with the learned pages that when the stock came to be examined scarcely a single copy could be made up from the wreck of the sheets” (DNB)—making complete copies very scarce today. Originally issued as a single, very thick folio volume, this copy has been bound in two, with no title page in Volume II (none issued). Castell’s Lexicon is at times found paired with Walton’s six-volume Polyglot Bible, which was also published by Roycroft, but issued separately 12 years prior, in 1657.","iso":"heb","script":"Hebr","year":1669,"country_id":"IL","copyright":"Public Domain","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"HEBHEPT","url":"https://archive.org/download/HEBHEPT_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1669)-Lexicon-Heptaglotton-Vol.-1-of-2.pdf","title":"Hebrew (1669) Lexicon Heptaglotton Vol. 1 of 2","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"553778914","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"},{"bible_abbr":"HEBHEPT","url":"https://archive.org/download/HEBHEPT_DBS_HS/Hebrew-(1669)-Lexicon-Heptaglotton-Vol.-2-of-2.pdf","title":"Hebrew (1669) Lexicon Heptaglotton Vol. 2 of 2","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"541663151","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"}],"language":{"iso":"heb","glotto_id":"hebr1245","iso1":"he","name":"Hebrew","autonym":"Israeli Hebrew","level":"L","area":"Also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Palestinian West Bank and Gaza, Panama, United Kingdom, United States.","country_id":"IL","latitude":31.10565,"longitude":35.01788,"population":5000000,"status_id":"1"},"country":{"id":"IL","name":"Israel","name_long":"The State of Israel","population":8787045,"official_language":"Hebrew","official_language_iso":"heb","iso_a3":"ISR","continent_id":"AS","iso_num":376,"language_count":57,"religion_primary":"Ethnic Religions","introduction":"Following World War II Britain withdrew from its mandate of Palestine and the UN proposed partitioning the area into Arab and Jewish states an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Nonetheless an Israeli state was declared in 1948 and Israel subsequently defeated the Arab armies in a series of wars that did not end deep tensions between the two sides. (The territories Israel has occupied since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile unless otherwise noted.) On 25 April 1982 Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991 Israel conducted bilateral negotiations with Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent settlement with each. Israel and Palestinian officials on 13 September 1993 signed a Declaration of Principles (also known as the \\\"Oslo Accords\\\") enshrining the idea of a two-state solution to their conflict and guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. The parties achieved six additional significant interim agreements between 1994 and 1999 aimed at creating the conditions for a two-state solution but most were never fully realized. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. ++ Progress toward a final status agreement with the Palestinians was undermined by Israeli-Palestinian violence between 2001 and February 2005. Israel in 2005 unilaterally disengaged from the Gaza Strip evacuating settlers and its military while retaining control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election of HAMAS to head the Palestinian Legislative Council in 2006 temporarily froze relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Israel engaged in a 34-day conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon from July-August 2006 and a 23-day conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip from December 2008-January 2009. In November 2012 Israel engaged in a seven-day conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip. Direct talks with the Palestinians most recently launched in July 2013 but were suspended in April 2014. The talks represented the fourth concerted effort to resolve final status issues between the sides since they were first discussed at Camp David in 2000. Three months later HAMAS and other militant groups launched rockets into Israel which led to a 51-day conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza.","overview":"'Israel a Middle Eastern country on the Mediterranean Sea is regarded by Jews Christians and Muslims as the biblical Holy Land.
