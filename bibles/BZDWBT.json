Latin script (also called the Roman script) is the most widely used writing system in the world, being the script of the English language, spoken by over 300,000,000 people worldwide. It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"bzd","glotto_id":"brib1243","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Bribri","autonym":"Talamanca","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Costa Rica","area":"South, Limón Province, Canton of Talamanca, along Lari, Telire, Uren rivers; Puntarenas Province, Canton of Buenos Aires.","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"CR","latitude":"9.397940","longitude":"-83.053950","population":12800,"status_id":"5","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"CR","name":"Costa Rica","name_long":"The Republic of Costa Rica","population":5151140,"official_language":"Spanish","official_language_iso":"spa","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"CS","iso_a3":"CRI","continent_id":"NA","iso_num":188,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a combination of factors including disease from mosquito-infested swamps brutal heat resistance by natives and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was established in the cooler fertile central highlands. The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821 Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined the United Provinces of Central America but this federation disintegrated in 1838 at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century only two brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic development. In 1949 Costa Rica dissolved its armed forces. Although it still maintains a large agricultural sector Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.","overview":"Costa Rica is a rugged rainforested Central American country with coastlines on the Caribbean and Pacific. Though its capital San Jose is home to cultural institutions like the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum Costa Rica is known for its beaches volcanoes and biodiversity. Roughly a quarter of its area is made up of protected jungle teeming with wildlife including spider monkeys and quetzal birds.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":17,"land_mass_km":51060,"population_christian":3912000,"population_christian_percentage":83,"population_catholic_percentage":69,"population_protestant_percentage":14,"population_refugee":6217,"population_migration":4200,"population_year_change":0.92,"population_density_km":100,"population_average_age":33,"population_urban_percentage":80,"population_literacy_percentage":"94.00","landmass":null,"region_code":11,"region_id":"419","region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean"}}
