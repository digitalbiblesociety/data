After almost three centuries as a Spanish colony Guatemala won its independence in 1821. During the second half of the 20th century it experienced a variety of military and civilian governments as well as a 36-year guerrilla war. In 1996 the government signed a peace agreement formally ending the internal conflict which had left more than 200000 people dead and had created by some estimates about 1 million refugees.","overview":"Guatemala a Central American country south of Mexico is home to volcanoes rainforests and ancient Mayan sites.
