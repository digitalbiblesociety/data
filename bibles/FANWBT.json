A quarter century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-Nguesso and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest. Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March 2003. The Republic of Congo is one of Africa's largest petroleum producers but with declining production it will need new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings over the long term.","overview":"'The Republic of the Congo also called Congo-Brazzaville is a central African nation with rainforest reserves that are habitats for gorillas. Its capital city Brazzaville lies across the Congo River from Kinshasa the capital of neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Brazzaville''s highlights include traditional craft markets and the mid-20th-century Basilique Sainte-Anne with a green-tiled roof and spire.'","independent":1,"landmass_km":341500,"population_christian":3409000,"population_christian_percentage":90.7,"population_catholic_percentage":50,"population_protestant_percentage":40,"population_refugee":25670,"population_migration":-4000,"population_year_change":2.56,"population_density_km":16,"population_average_age":19,"population_urban_percentage":70,"population_literacy_percentage":77,"region_code":8,"region_id":202,"region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Republic-of-the-Congo","url_national_society":"http://alliancebiblique-congo.org/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/bible-society-of-congo/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/congo-republic-of-the/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/CF-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/COG","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/congo_roc.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Africa/Congo","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/congo-republic-of","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/republic-of-the-congo/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/CG","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/congo.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/77060166","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Congo_dload_hi.mp4"}}
