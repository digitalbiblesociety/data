    "description": "The Ferrar Fenton Bible owes its existence and name to Ferrar Fentan a British businessman working in Victorian London who believed that Western Christianity was in peril and that a new translation was needed, and so it was that in 1853 he published his own translation of Paul’’s epistles, releasing further books until the entire Bible was translated in 1903, his stated goal being \"to study the Bible absolutely in its original languages, to ascertain what its writers actually said and thought.”",
