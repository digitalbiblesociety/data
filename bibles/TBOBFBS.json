{"abbr":"TBOBFBS","title":"Tavara Old Bible Portions","title_vernacular":"Tavara Mateus","description":"Tawala is an Oceanic language of the Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea. It is spoken by 20,000 people who live in hamlets and small villages on the East Cape peninsula, on the shores of Milne Bay, and on areas of the islands of Sideia and Basilaki. There are approximately 40 main centers of the population each speaking the same dialect, although through the process of colonization some centers have gained more prominence than others. The larger group of historically related languages—called Shona languages by linguists—also includes Ndau (Eastern Shona) and Kalanga (Western Shona).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1898 Mark London MS, Auckland;  1903 Matthew BFBS, London Translated by LMS teachers from Samoa.;  1930 Mark (revised) BFBS, London Revised by R.

After World War II the communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that while ensuring China's sovereignty imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978 MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded yet political controls remain tight. Since the early 1990s China has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.","overview":"'China is a populous nation in East Asia whose vast landscape encompasses grassland desert mountains lakes rivers and more than 14000km of coastline.
