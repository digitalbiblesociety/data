Joseph Bryant Rotherham’s passion project, the Emphasized BIble uses a method known as “emphatic idiom” to illuminate the special nuances of Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic texts that do not come through in most English-language translations of the Bible. Rotherham was a minister in the Church of Christ and wrote this translation to  \"[place] the reader of the present time in as good a position as that occupied by the reader of the first century for understanding the Apostolic Writings.\"",
