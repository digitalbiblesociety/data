It is also used to write a number of minority languages in Thailand, Laos and China, as well as Pali, which is widely used in Buddhist temples and monasteries. Both the Thai language and script are closely related to Laotian. The script is of Indic origin, derived from Old Khmer.</p> <p>The Thai script is an abugida that reads from left to right. The relationship between letters and sounds is complex; 44 letters are used to represent 21 consonant phonemes. This is largely due to the way in which the languages sound system has changed over time. Some sounds used to be distinctive - that is, they used to differentiate between otherwise identical words - but these distinctions have now become obsolete. However, the sounds continue to be written using different letters. In addition, Thai vocabulary has been borrowed from Sanskrit, Pali, Old Khmer, English and Teochew Chinese, and it is often necessary to know the origin of the word in order to spell it correctly.</p> <p>Consonants contain an inherent vowel, either a or o, which can be modified by means of vowel diacritics. Words in which a consonant is pronounced without a vowel are written with a symbol called a virama, which mutes the inherent vowel. There are no independent letters to represent syllable-initial vowels; syllables which are pronounced with an initial vowel are written with a glottal stop and the appropriate vowel diacritic is joined to it.</p> <p>Tone is represented partly by qualities inherent in the consonant symbol, partly by the structure of the syllable and partly by tone marks.</p> <p>Word breaks are not indicated by spaces, rather, spaces are used to separate clauses or sentences. A Latin comma and full stop are sometimes used, but not by everybody. There also used to be a symbol (now obsolete) for separating paragraphs. Additional non-alphabetic symbols include an abbreviation marker, a symbol to indicate that a word or letter is repeated, a symbol to indicate that a letter is not pronounced, and a letter equivalent in meaning to the English abbreviation etc.. Thai digits from 0-9 are used; these are almost identical to Khmer digits. Latin numerals are also used.</p> <p>Please note that, although orthographically the Thai script does exhibit reordering behaviour, that reordering is not typically reflected in software implementations. See <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/l5bvp27v3r>Reordering and Data Storage Order</a> for more details of this.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"bzi","glotto_id":"bisu1244","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Bisu","autonym":"????","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Southwestern China","area":"Southwest Yunan Province, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Menghai County, Mengzhe village; Simao Prefecture, Lancang Lahu Autonomous County, Zhutang, Laba, Donglang, and Fubang villages; Meglian Dai, Lahu, and Va autonomous counties, Jingxin, Fuyan, and Nanya villages; parts of Ximeng Va Autonomous County.

Known as Siam until 1939 Thailand is the only Southeast Asian country never to have been colonized by a European power. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. In alliance with Japan during World War II Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and later fighting alongside the US in Vietnam. Thailand since 2005 has experienced several rounds of political turmoil including a military coup in 2006 that ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat followed by large-scale street protests by competing political factions in 2008 2009 and 2010. THAKSIN's youngest sister YINGLAK Chinnawat in 2011 led the Puea Thai Party to an electoral win and assumed control of the government. A blanket amnesty bill for individuals involved in street protests altered at the last minute to include all political crimes - including all convictions against THAKSIN - triggered months of large-scale anti-government protests in Bangkok beginning in November 2013. In early May 2014 YINGLAK was removed from office by the Constitutional Court and in late May 2014 the Royal Thai Army staged a coup against the caretaker government. Then head of the Royal Thai Army Gen. PRAYUT Chan-ocha was appointed prime minister in August 2014. The interim military government created several interim institutions to promote reform and draft a new constitution. Elections are tentatively set for mid-2017. King PHUMIPHON Adunyadet passed away in October 2016 after 70 years on the throne; his only son WACHIRALONGKON Bodinthrathepphayawarangkun ascended the throne in December 2016. Thailand has also experienced violence associated with the ethno-nationalist insurgency in its southern Malay-Muslim majority provinces. Since January 2004 thousands have been killed and wounded in the insurgency.","overview":"'Thailand is a Southeast Asian country.
