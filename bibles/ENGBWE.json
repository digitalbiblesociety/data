    "description": "The Bible in Worldwide English is largely Annie Cressmanâ€™s labor of love. Cressman was a Canadian teach who travelled moved to Liberia to teach English and the Bible, the latter often through the former. In describing her teaching process, she says that \"she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself, and, therefore, decided to write a simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\" In 1959, she published her Gospel of Mark and SOON Publications in India helped her create  a complete New Testament in 1969. She continued translating portions of the Bible until her death in 1999. ",
