The fusing of European and various African cultural traditions is reflected in Cabo Verde’s Crioulo language music and pano textiles. Following independence in 1975 and a tentative interest in unification with Guinea-Bissau a one-party system was established and maintained until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cabo Verde continues to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments. Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result Cabo Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one. Most Cabo Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents. Cabo Verde’s population descends from its first permanent inhabitants in the late 15th-century – a preponderance of West African slaves a small share of Portuguese colonists and even fewer Italians Spaniards and Portuguese Jews. The fusing of European and various African cultural traditions is reflected in Cabo Verde’s Crioulo language music and pano textiles. Among the nine inhabited islands population distribution is variable. Islands in the east are very dry and are only sparsely settled to exploit their extensive salt deposits. The more southerly islands receive more precipitation and support larger populations but agriculture and livestock grazing have damaged their soil fertility and vegetation. For centuries the country’s overall population size has fluctuated significantly as recurring periods of famine and epidemics have caused high death tolls and emigration.","overview":"Cape Verde or Cabo Verde is a nation on a volcanic archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa.
