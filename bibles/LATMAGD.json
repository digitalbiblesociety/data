This is also the case with this psalter, which probably was produced in the Magdeburg region. In the calendar, of which the first leaf with the January page is missing, rare medical cures are shown as monthly activities in the spring months: bloodletting in February, a spa treatment in March, a wound treatment in April, a drinking cure in May, and so forth. The calendar pages resembling a diptych include in the tympanum, in the upper left, the signs of the zodiac, and, in the upper-right field the monthly activities. Below in the left column is the calendar text; in the right column are the twelve apostles. The psalter section is initiated by a full-page initial “B” for Beatus vir (Blessed is the man). In the lower arch of the \"B\" King David is shown with the harp; in the upper arch Christ is depicted as the Man of Sorrows. Opposite is an ornamental text page with the beginning of the first psalm in golden capital letters. Additional historiated initials comprising nine or even ten lines appear in each of the divisions of the tenths of the psalter. The illustrations contained therein are complementary to the full-page miniatures on the opposite page, both constituting a cycle of the life of Jesus. On the second of the miniatures, to Psalm 38, the Presentation in the Temple is shown, while the opposing initial depicts the baptism of Jesus. The cycle spans the scourging, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, and Pentecost, up to Maiestas Domini (Christ in Majesty) in Psalm 109, followed by an initial with the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. In the litany are found miniatures of saints. According to a note by Johann Friedrich Hekel on the first leaf, the manuscript originally came from the Bibliotheca Palatina in Heidelberg. Hekel himself, who died in 1700, had purchased it from a rabbi in Frankfurt. The psalter thus seems to have been lost before the Heidelberg library was transferred to Rome in 1622. When and in what way the codex came into the Munich Court Library, the present-day Bavarian State Library, is unknown.

It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","macroarea":null,"level":"A","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"VA","latitude":"41.902640","longitude":"12.450210","population":0,"status_id":"3","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"VA","name":"Holy See  Vatican","name_long":"The Holy See","population":1000,"official_language":"Latin","official_language_iso":"lat","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"VT","iso_a3":"VAT","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":336,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy.

Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion.
