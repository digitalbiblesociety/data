The Bible was translated from Vulgate by Camaldolese monks at Červený Kláštor monastery. The completed translation had been rewritten in 1756–1759. The translation is characterized by the effort to use forms and expressions of common Slovak spoken language, with distinctive Western-Slovak elements and some literary linguistic elements of Czech origin.",
