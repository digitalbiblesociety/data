It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"tuk","glotto_id":"turk1304","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"tk","name":"Turkmen","autonym":"تۆرکمن ديلی ","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Afghanistan","area":"Also in Afghanistan, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russian Federation (Asia), Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey (Asia), United States, Uzbekistan.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"TM","latitude":"37.087194","longitude":"59.175736","population":7061000,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"TM","name":"Turkmenistan","name_long":"Turkmenistan","population":5579889,"official_language":"Turkmen","official_language_iso":"tuk","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"TX","iso_a3":"TKM","continent_id":"AS","iso_num":795,"religion_primary":"Islam","introduction":"Present-day Turkmenistan covers territory that has been at the crossroads of civilizations for centuries. The area was ruled in antiquity by various Persian empires and was conquered by Alexander the Great Muslim crusaders the Mongols Turkic warriors and eventually the Russians. In medieval times Merv (today known as Mary) was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by Russia in the late 1800s Turkmenistan later figured prominently in the anti-Bolshevik movement in Central Asia. In 1924 Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic; it achieved independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Extensive hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves which have yet to be fully exploited have begun to transform the country. Turkmenistan is moving to expand its extraction and delivery projects. The Government of Turkmenistan is actively working to diversify its gas export routes beyond the still important Russian pipeline network. In 2010 new gas export pipelines that carry Turkmen gas to China and to northern Iran began operating effectively ending the Russian monopoly on Turkmen gas exports. President for Life Saparmurat NYYAZOW died in December 2006 and Turkmenistan held its first multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007. Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW emerged as the country's new president; he was chosen as president again in February 2012 in an election that the OSCE said lacked the freedoms necessary to create a competitive environment.","overview":"Turkmenistan is a country in Central Asia bordered by the Caspian Sea and largely covered by the Karakum Desert. It’s known for archaeological ruins including those at Nisa and Merv major stops along the ancient trade route the Silk Road.
