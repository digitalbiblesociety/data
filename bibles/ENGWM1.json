All we ask is that if you CHANGE the actual text of the World Messianic Bible in any way, you not call the result the World Messianic Bible any more. This is to avoid confusion, not to limit your freedom. The Holy Bible is God's Word. It belongs to God. He gave it to us freely, and we who have worked on this translation freely give it to you by dedicating it to the Public Domain.<br>Donations to help with the expenses of this project and thus help others have free access to the Word of God may be made to us, but are not required.
