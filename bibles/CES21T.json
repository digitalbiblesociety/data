{"abbr":"CES21T","title":"21st  Century Czech Translation","title_vernacular":"Překlad 21. století","description":"Bible21 is a contemporary translation of the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek Scriptures into modern-day Czech language. Avoiding literalism on the one hand and a free paraphrase on the other, it strives to communicate clearly, yet faithfully both the meaning and the literary style of biblical writings. A team of evangelical translators and linguists led by Alexander Flek has worked on this version for 15 years. Since 2009 when it was first published, Bible21 became widely popular among the Czech churches and the general public. © 2009 by BIBLION ","iso":"ces","script":"Latn","year":2009,"country_id":"CZ","copyright":"© 2009 BIBLION","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://www.bible21.cz/ke-stazeni/audio","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"audio_web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible21.cz","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"http://www.bible21.cz/online","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible21.cz","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"http://www.biblion.cz/detail/19-bible21-brown","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"404","provider":"Biblion.cz","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"http://pns.tode.cz/data/bible21/BIBLE21.pdf","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible 21","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"http://www.beblia.com/pages/main.aspx?Language=Czech\u0026Book=1\u0026Chapter=1","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Beblia","visible":false},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo\u0026vid=184\u0026lang=53","title":"Čeština (CS)","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible Gateway","visible":true,"organization_id":"9696ef31-b54c-4a20-82ab-f1b8a527e48a"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/15-b21-bible-21","title":"Bible 21","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"BIBLION","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/509-csp-cesky-studijni-preklad","title":"Český studijní překlad","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Nadacní fond prekladu Bible","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://www.bible.com/sr/audio-bible-app-versions/15","title":"Bible, překlad 21. století","scope":"","type":"audio","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Youversion","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://bible.com/versions/15","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://bible.com/versions/509","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","url":"https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=CzeB21","title":"Crosswire Module","provider":"The Sword Project","visible":true,"organization_id":"dde7cec9-f63e-4370-b4b6-a841c44adda2"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","organization_id":"9696ef31-b54c-4a20-82ab-f1b8a527e48a","equivalent_id":"15","site":"biblegateway.com","suffix":"","type":"web-app","url":""},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"15","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/15"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"509","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/509"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","organization_id":"dde7cec9-f63e-4370-b4b6-a841c44adda2","equivalent_id":"CzeB21","site":"Crosswire","url":"https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=CzeB21"},{"bible_abbr":"CES21T","equivalent_id":"5473377a5117ad3b3e2ce3f1","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"language":{"iso":"ces","glotto_id":"czec1258","iso1":"cs","name":"Czech","autonym":"čeština","level":"L","area":"West: Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia.

During the interwar years having rejected a federal system the new country's predominantly Czech leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the increasingly strident demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic most notably the Slovaks the Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). On the eve of World War II Nazi Germany occupied the territory that today comprises the Czech Republic and Slovakia became an independent state allied with Germany. After the war a reunited but truncated Czechoslovakia (less Ruthenia) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968 an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize communist rule and create \\\"socialism with a human face\\\" ushering in a period of repression known as \\\"normalization.\\\" The peaceful \\\"Velvet Revolution\\\" swept the Communist Party from power at the end of 1989 and inaugurated a return to democratic rule and a market economy. On 1 January 1993 the country underwent a nonviolent \\\"velvet divorce\\\" into its two national components the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.","overview":"'The Czech Republic in Central Europe is a country that''s known for its ornate castles native beers and long history.
