five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration economic dependence on South Africa a severe drought and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the mid-1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989 and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004 Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor Armando GUEBUZA served two terms and then passed executive power to Filipe NYUSI in October 2014. RENAMO’s residual armed forces engaged in a low-level insurgency from 2012 to 2014.","overview":"Mozambique is a southern African nation whose long Indian Ocean coastline is dotted with popular beaches like Tofo as well as offshore marine parks. In the Quirimbas Archipelago a 250km stretch of coral islands mangrove-covered Ibo Island has colonial-era ruins surviving from a period of Portuguese rule. The Bazaruto Archipelago farther south has reefs which protect rare marine life including dugongs.","independent":1,"landmass_km":786380,"population_christian":13121000,"population_christian_percentage":56.1,"population_catholic_percentage":28.4,"population_protestant_percentage":27.7,"population_refugee":4708,"population_migration":-5000,"population_year_change":2.93,"population_density_km":40,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":38,"population_literacy_percentage":55,"region_code":7,"region_id":202,"region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Mozambique","url_national_society":"http://www.sociedadebiblica.org.mz/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/bible-society-in-mozambique/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/mozambique/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/MZ-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/MOZ","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/mozambique.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Africa/Mozambique","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/mozambique","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/mozambique/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/MZ","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/mozambique.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/21997628","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Mozambique2_dload_hi.mp4"}}
