Germany annexed the island in 1888. A German-British consortium began mining the island's phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent republic.","overview":"'Nauru is a tiny island country in Micronesia northeast of Australia. It features a coral reef and white-sand beaches fringed with palms including Anibare Bay on the east coast. Inland tropical vegetation surrounds Buada Lagoon. The rocky outcrop of Command Ridge the island''s highest point has a rusty Japanese outpost from WWII. The underground freshwater lake of Moqua Well lies amid the limestone Moqua Caves.'","independent":1,"landmass_km":20,"population_refugee":763,"population_year_change":0.63,"population_density_km":541,"population_literacy_percentage":97,"region_code":1,"region_id":57,"region_name":"Micronesia","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Nauru","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/nauru/","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/nauru.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Oceania/Nauru","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/nauru","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/nauru/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/NR","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/nauru.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/75979437","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Nauru_dload_hi.mp4"}}
