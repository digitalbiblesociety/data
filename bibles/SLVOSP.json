In 1918 the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational state which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia which though communist distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe a strong economy and a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004; it joined the euro zone and the Schengen zone in 2007.","overview":"Slovenia a country in Central Europe is known for its mountains ski resorts and lakes.
