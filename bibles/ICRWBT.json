    "description": "The New Testament in San Andres Islander Creole was translated by Ron and Lois Metzger. They worked with the native population that spoke an English Creole to create the written Creole. They spent five years there before returning to the U.S., though the translation project remained unfinished. They were able to connect with expat Creole speakers in Dallas and were able to continue the translation process. Lois would not see the completion of the New Testament translation project as she passed away from lung cancer in 2008, seven years before the New Testament was published.",
