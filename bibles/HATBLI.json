In the early 17th century the French established a presence on Hispaniola. In 1697 Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island which later became Haiti. The French colony based on forestry and sugar-related industries became one of the wealthiest in the Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th century Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle Haiti became the first post-colonial black-led nation in the world declaring its independence in 1804. Currently the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere Haiti has experienced political instability for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE in February 2004 an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations. Continued instability and technical delays prompted repeated postponements but Haiti inaugurated a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006. This was followed by contested elections in 2010 that resulted in the election of Haiti's current President Michel MARTELLY. A massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with an epicenter about 25 km (15 mi) west of the capital Port-au-Prince. Estimates are that over 300000 people were killed and some 1.5 million left homeless. The earthquake was assessed as the worst in this region over the last 200 years.","overview":"'Haiti is a Caribbean country that shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic to its east. Though it’s still recovering from a 2010 earthquake many of Haiti''s landmarks dating to the early 19th century remain intact. These include Citadelle la Ferrière a mountaintop fortress and the nearby ruins of Sans-Souci Palace the baroque former royal home of King Henry I.'","independent":1,"landmass_km":27560,"population_christian":9597000,"population_christian_percentage":96,"population_catholic_percentage":80,"population_protestant_percentage":16,"population_refugee":2,"population_migration":-35000,"population_year_change":1.24,"population_density_km":414,"population_average_age":24,"population_urban_percentage":57,"population_literacy_percentage":60,"region_code":12,"region_id":419,"region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Haiti","url_national_society":"http://societebiblique-haiti.org/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/haitian-bible-society/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/haiti/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/HA-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/HTI","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/haiti.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Caribbean/Haiti","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/haiti","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/haiti/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/HT","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/haiti.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/21168187","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Haiti_dload_hi.mov"}}
