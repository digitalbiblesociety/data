The first volume contains all the books of the Old Testament from the Book of Genesis (with the first part of the Book of Genesis up to 24:19 missing) to the Second Book of Kings, as well as the psalter. The first chapters of the Gospel of Matthew (1:1–5:44) were accidentally bound into this volume between the Book of Numbers and the Book of Deuteronomy. The volume is illustrated by 60 miniatures and additional floral motifs; these were executed in Ratisbon as well, in a style resembling (though slightly predating) the illuminations of Berthold Furtmeyr (active 1460–1501), who is considered one of the finest German illuminators of his time. The second volume, also by Rorer, contains the books of the Old Testament from the Book of Paralipomenon (also known as I and II Chronicles) to the Book of Malachi, as well as single prologues to the books of the Bible, comprising, among others, those to the major and minor prophets, as well as to the four gospels. It is noteworthy that the codex also contains two prologues by the Frankish Benedictine monk Rabanus Magnentius Maurus (circa 784–856, also known as Hrabanus Maurus) to the two books of the Maccabees. The second volume is illustrated by 52 miniatures and additional floral motifs, also in a style resembling that of Furtmeyr.

This script is thought to have been invented around 350AD by the bishop Ulfilas for the purpose of translating the Bible into the Gothic language. The runic script which had previously been used for writing this language had strong associations with Germanic paganism, so was not deemed appropriate for this purpose. The Gothic language continued to be spoken until the 17th century, but there is no record of the script being used beyond the 6th century. </li> <li>Ulfilas based the Gothic script largely on an uncial form of the Greek alphabet, with some influence from the Runic and Latin scripts also. It was written from left to right, without spaces between words. Some texts were written with a space, dot or colon between phrases and others were <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#colom target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;<span class=Em>colometric</span></a>, with every distinctive clause starting on a new line. </li> <li>The script was comprised of twenty-seven letters.

Nasals were optionally omitted in writing from the ends of words. Ligatures were used very rarely.</li> <li>There were no numbers in the Gothic script; rather, each letter was assigned a numeric value. If a symbol was intended to be read as a number, it was horizontally flanked by centred dots, or vertically flanked by horizontal lines.</li> </ul>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"gmh","glotto_id":"midd1343","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Middle High German (ca. 1050-1500)","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"H","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":null,"progress":null,"typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"DE","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"population":0,"status_id":"9","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"DE","name":"Germany","name_long":"The Federal Republic of Germany","population":79903481,"official_language":"German Standard","official_language_iso":"deu","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"GM","iso_a3":"DEU","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":276,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia) Germany is a key member of the continent's economic political and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US UK France and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations the EC which became the EU and NATO while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999 Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency the euro.","overview":"Germany is a Western European country with a landscape of forests rivers mountain ranges and North Sea beaches.
