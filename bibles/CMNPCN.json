After World War II the communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that while ensuring China's sovereignty imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978 MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded yet political controls remain tight. Since the early 1990s China has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.","overview":"'China is a populous nation in East Asia whose vast landscape encompasses grassland desert mountains lakes rivers and more than 14000km of coastline.
