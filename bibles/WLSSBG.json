Notably Wallis and Futuna was the only French colony to side with the Vichy regime during World War II a phase that ended in May of 1942 with the arrival of 2000 American troops. In 1959 the inhabitants of the islands voted to become a French overseas territory and officially assumed this status in July 1961.","overview":"Wallis and Futuna officially the Territory of the Wallis and Futuna Islands is a French island collectivity in the South Pacific between Tuvalu to the northwest Fiji to the southwest Tonga to the southeast Samoa to the east and Tokelau to the northeast.
