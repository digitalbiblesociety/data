{"abbr":"ENGWES","title":"Wesleys New Testament with Notes","description":"John Wesley’s translation of the New Testament was published in 1754. He also translated the Old Testament, but that was not published until 1764. Wesley’s translation of the New Testament was meant to correct thousands of errors that were contained within the King James Version, and he consulted the Greek texts directly in order to do this. Wesley’s notes are provided below the text on each page, and the text itself is paragraphed, instead of versed. A portrait of Wesley preaching is also printed at the beginning of the Bible. In Wesley’s words from the Preface, \"I have never knowingly, so much as in one place, altered [the Bible] for altering's sake; but there only, where, first, the sense was made better, stronger, clearer or more consistent with the context; secondly, where the sense being equally good, the phrase was better or nearer the original.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e[Many modifications of the AV, approximately 12,000 single word changes.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReprinted, 1757.

At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe.
