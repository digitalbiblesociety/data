{"abbr":"LATECHT","title":"Echternach Gospel Lectionary","title_vernacular":"Lectionarium Evangelii Echternach","description":"The illumination of this early 11th century lectionary is a late example of the Ottonian tradition of book illumination. The manuscript features 292 golden majuscule initials, 30 initials in gold, and five decorated text pages, as well as a full-page initial and a miniature of Christ in Majesty. The 16-line introductory poem on folio 1 verso is written in gold rustic capitals on purple ground. On the opposite page is a depiction of Christ in Majesty: Christ making the sign of blessing sits enthroned within the mandorla, accompanied by the symbols of the Evangelists located in the corners of the frame. The manuscript is assumed by many to have been written in the abbey of Echternach (in present-day Luxembourg), however, its origin remains disputed among scholars. After a period of private ownership, the manuscript was acquired in the 18th century by Provost Franziscus Töpsl for Polling Abbey and was transferred to the Munich court library in 1803.

In 1870 the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East sexual misconduct by clergy international development interreligious dialogue and reconciliation and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1.2 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith.","overview":"'Vatican City a city-state surrounded by Rome Italy is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.
