It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"ame","glotto_id":"yane1238","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Yanesha'","autonym":"Yaneshac̈h","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Peru","area":"Central and east Pasco region; Junín, western jungle, headwaters of Pachitea and Perene rivers.","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"PE","latitude":"-10.545390","longitude":"-75.314970","population":7520,"status_id":"5","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"PE","name":"Peru","name_long":"The Republic of Perú","population":32201224,"official_language":"Spanish","official_language_iso":"spa","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"PE","iso_a3":"PER","continent_id":"SA","iso_num":604,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peru declared its independence in 1821 and remaining Spanish forces were defeated in 1824. After a dozen years of military rule Peru returned to democratic leadership in 1980 but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction with his regime which led to his resignation in 2000. A caretaker government oversaw a new election in the spring of 2001 which installed Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government - Peru's first democratically elected president of indigenous ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan GARCIA Perez who after a disappointing presidential term from 1985 to 1990 oversaw a robust economic rebound. Former army officer Ollanta HUMALA Tasso was elected president in June 2011 and carried on the sound market-oriented economic policies of the three preceding administrations. Poverty and unemployment levels have fallen dramatically in the last decade and today Peru boasts one of the best performing economies in Latin America. Pedro Pablo KUCZYNSKI Godard won a very narrow presidential runoff election in June 2016.","overview":"'Peru is a country in South America that''s home to a section of Amazon rainforest and Machu Picchu an ancient Incan city high in the Andes mountains.
