{"abbr":"PORBAP","title":"De Almeida Bible (1641)","title_vernacular":"De Almeida Bíblia","description":"Ferreira de Almeida's translation of the Bible into Portuguese is most closely associated with Portuguese-speaking Protestant Christians and is the most commonly used translation by Portuguese-speaking Evangelicals, particularly in Brazil. His work is the source of many Bible versions, like the Edição Revista e Corrigida (Revised and Corrected Edition, published in 1948, is an update of other editions), the Edição Revista e Atualizada (Revised and Updated Edition, most based in newer manuscripts), published by Brazilian Bible Society and Portuguese Bible Society, Almeida Corrigida e Fiel (Almeida Corrected and Faithful), by Trinitarian Bible Society of Brazil, and Edição Contemporânea de Almeida (Almeida's Contemporary Edition), by Editora Vida. In 2015, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published its own edition of the Bible in Portuguese based on Ferreira de Almeida's translation.","iso":"por","script":"Latn","year":1681,"country_id":"PT","copyright":"Public Domain","copyright_type":"OPEN","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","url":"https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/products/9789728780791/","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"British and Foreign Bible Society","visible":false,"organization_id":"d3950ccc-dc18-4e63-92c2-a0f5e2eef6ac"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","url":"https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/bible/portuguese/","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"New Christian Bible Study","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","url":"https://archive.org/download/PORBAP_DBS_HS/Portuguese-(1681)-Novo-Testamento-Almeida.pdf","title":"Portuguese (1681) Novo Testamento Almeida","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"187234586","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"53eb2a6c5117ad243d17960d","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"53eb2a705117ad248f74df51","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546493f75117ad4aa1d95ef5","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546493f95117ad4b1fbb5541","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546493fb5117ad4b1fbb5543","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546493fd5117ad4b1fbb5545","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546493fe5117ad4aa1d95efa","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546494115117ad4ae75b9867","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546494125117ad4aa1d95f09","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546494165117ad4b1fbb5556","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546494175117ad4aa1d95f0c","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"546494185117ad4b1fbb5558","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"5464941a5117ad4ae75b986d","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"PORBAP","equivalent_id":"54717f275117ad64791e5af0","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"language":{"iso":"por","glotto_id":"port1283","iso1":"pt","name":"Portuguese","autonym":"português","level":"L","location":"Portugal and Spain","area":"Iberia, Azores, Madeira.

A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next six decades repressive governments ran the country. In 1974 a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year Portugal granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.","overview":"'Portugal is a southern European country on the Iberian Peninsula bordering Spain.
