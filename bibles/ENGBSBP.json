    "description": "The Berean Study Bible (BSB) is a completely new translation of the Holy Bible, effective for public reading, study, memorization, and evangelism. Based on the best available manuscripts and sources, each word is connected back to the Greek or Hebrew text to produce a transparent text that can be studied for its root meanings. The BSB represents a single tier of the Berean Bible. This printing contains the full BSB text, footnotes, section headings, and cross references. Additional components, including translation tables, lexicons, outlines, and summaries, are free online and in a variety of apps and software. The Berean Bible Translation Committee has employed an open process where translation tables are freely available and all comments are welcomed and considered. These sources may also be downloaded and shared freely. Please see the Berean Bible website for a full description of the translation committee and process.",
