The manuscript reached Frankish Gaul during the eighth century. It was kept in Tours during the following century, where it remained for about 1,000 years. The manuscript is fragmentary. Originally 208 folios, it contains 129 original folios and 13 folios made in eastern France and added in the ninth century (folios 3‒4, 8, 37‒38, 60‒64, 122, 129) including one Carolingian folio (folio 33). References to gaps in the text were noted in several places on the manuscript in the tenth century. The biblical books preserved are (with significant gaps): Genesis, folio 2 recto‒49 verso (starts with a table of contents); Exodus, folios 51 recto‒90 verso (with a table of chapters under arches, folios 51 recto‒53 recto, the end missing); Leviticus, folio 91 recto‒115 recto; Numbers, folios 115 verso‒141 verso; and Deuteronomy, folio 142 recto. The writing is in uncial script, with marginal additions mixing uncials and half-uncials, sometimes with ligatures. Folio 32 verso is in Carolingian minuscule. The manuscript originally contained 69 full-page paintings, only 18 of which remain; many of them contain multiple narratives. It was stolen in Tours in 1842 by Count Guglielmo Libri, a mathematician, physicist, and Inspector of the Libraries of France, a position he used to purloin many precious books and manuscripts. He sold almost 2,000 of them, including the Pentateuch, to the bibliophile fourth Earl of Ashburnham in 1847. After the death of the earl in 1878, and after lengthy negotiations, the manuscript was acquired by the National Library of France in 1888.

It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","macroarea":null,"level":"A","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"VA","latitude":"41.902640","longitude":"12.450210","population":0,"status_id":"3","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"VA","name":"Holy See  Vatican","name_long":"The Holy See","population":1000,"official_language":"Latin","official_language_iso":"lat","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"VT","iso_a3":"VAT","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":336,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy.

Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy.
