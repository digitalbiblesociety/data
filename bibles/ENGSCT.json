    "description": "Charles Thomson (1729-1824) was an American patriot in Philadelphia during the American Revolution and Secretary of the Continental Congress (1774-1789). In addition, he was the first person to translate the Greek Septuagint into English and the first American to translate the New Testament into English. His translation of the Bible was printed in 1808 by Jane Aitken (daughter of Robert Aitken who printed the first English Bible in America) who was the first woman to publish a Bible in America. In 1815 Thomson published a translation of the Gospels arranged as a harmony.",
