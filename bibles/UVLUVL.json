eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK (south) in 1885.

A nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in 1997 after claiming some 20000 lives.","overview":"Papua New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific encompasses the eastern half of New Guinea and its offshore islands.
