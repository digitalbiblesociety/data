{"abbr":"NOBB88","title":"1988 Norwegian Bible","title_vernacular":"Norsk Bibel 88/07","description":"The Norwegian Bible came with its first edition in 1988. In 2007 came NB 88/07, a careful revision of NB 88. The New Norwegian edition came in 1994. The Norwegian Bible is a concordant Bible translation (\"word-for-word translation\"). The aim is, as far as possible, to translate each of the basic text's words with one term into Norwegian. Our prayer to God is that this edition of the Bible will be a blessing to the Norwegian people.","description_vernacular":"Norsk Bibel kom med sin første utgave i 1988. I 2007 kom NB 88/07, en varsom revisjon av NB 88. Nynorskutgaven kom i 1994. Norsk Bibel er en konkordant bibeloversettelse («ord-for-ord oversettelse»). Målsetningen er, så langt det er mulig, å oversette hvert av grunntekstens ord med ett begrep på norsk. Vår bønn til Gud er at denne bibelutgaven skal bli til velsignelse for det norske folk.","iso":"nob","script":"Latn","year":1988,"country_id":"NO","copyright":"© 1988 Norsk Bibel","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"NOBB88","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/102-nb-norsk-bibel-88slash-07","title":"Norsk Bibel 88/07","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Norsk Bible","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"NOBB88","url":"https://bible.com/versions/102","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"NOBB88","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"102","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/102"},{"bible_abbr":"NOBB88","equivalent_id":"53eb2a345117ad21237e1f81","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"language":{"iso":"nob","glotto_id":"norw1259","iso1":"nb","name":"Norwegian Bokmål","autonym":"norsk bokmål","level":"L","country_id":"NO","latitude":61.112,"longitude":8.886},"country":{"id":"NO","name":"Norway","name_long":"The Kingdom of Norway","population":5509591,"official_language":"Norwegian","official_language_iso":"nor","iso_a3":"NOR","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":578,"language_count":51,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994; conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In 1397 Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814 Norwegians resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in World War I it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In 1949 Norway abandoned neutrality and became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. In referenda held in 1972 and 1994 Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include immigration and integration of ethnic minorities maintaining the country's extensive social safety net with an aging population and preserving economic competitiveness.","overview":"Norway is a Scandinavian country encompassing mountains glaciers and deep coastal fjords.
