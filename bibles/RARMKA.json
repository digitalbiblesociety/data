Charles Pittman translated the New Testament in the late 1820s through to the early 1830s. He left Rarotonga, Cook Islands in 1834 for England to conduct a series of fundraising lectures, publish his book Missionary Enterprises in the South Seas and to publish the Rarotongan Bible - New Testament. He came back to Rarotonga soon after, and left for the New Hebrides in 1839 where he was killed and eaten by cannibals at Erromanga on 20 November 1839. He was 43 years of age. The complete Bible was published in 1851.

The emigration of skilled workers to New Zealand government deficits and limited natural resources are of continuing concern.","overview":"The Cook Islands is a nation in the South Pacific with political links to New Zealand. Its 15 islands are scattered over a vast area. The largest island Rarotonga is home to rugged mountains and Avarua the national capital. To the north Aitutaki Island has a vast lagoon encircled by coral reefs and small sandy islets.
