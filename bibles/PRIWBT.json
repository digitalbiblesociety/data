It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864. Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia. The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2018 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.","overview":"'New Caledonia is a French territory comprising dozens of islands in the South Pacific. It''s known for its palm-lined beaches and marine-life-rich lagoon which at 24000-sq.-km is among the world''s largest.
