{"abbr":"HYEVNG","title":"Armenian Verin Noravank Gospels - Illuminated","description":"This beautifully illuminated gospel book was copied in 1487 AD at the Monastery of Verin Noravank in Armenia. The exact location of the monastery is unknown, although, since the late 1980s, it has been associated with the ruins of the Monastery of Arates (Aratesivank) of Siwnik. Verin Noravank was in close contact with the better-known Noravank of Amaghu, with which it has often been confused. Fewer than 15 manuscripts are known to have been copied at Verin Noravank. As was customary with most Armenian manuscripts, the Verin Noravank gospel contains a lengthy colophon that traces its own history. The colophon is also important because it contains one of the few references to the White Sheep Turkoman overlord of that region at the time, Yaqub Bek. The four miniatures of the Evangelists and the decorative illuminations in the text are striking features of the gospel book, which was acquired by the Library of Congress in 2008. Technical analysis of the illuminations has revealed that the artist used a number of rare pigments, including tin white (tin oxide, SnO2); a blue-pigment mixture of cobalt glass (smalt), ultramarine, and possibly indigo; and a mixed red lead-vermillion pigment. The use of these pigments suggests ingenuity on the part of the artist, as well as the influence of Near Eastern and indigenous ceramic and textile technologies.

Despite periods of autonomy over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman Byzantine Arab Persian and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia the Ottoman Empire instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918 but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. ++ Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh a primarily Armenian-populated region assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994 when a cease-fire took hold ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding regions approximately 14 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. ++ Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009 senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with Turkey aiming to secure an opening of the border but Turkey has not yet ratified the Protocols normalizing relations between the two countries. In January 2015 Armenia joined Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union.","overview":"Armenia is a nation and former Soviet republic in the mountainous Caucasus region between Asia and Europe. Among the earliest Christian civilizations it’s defined by religious sites including the Greco-Roman Temple of Garni and 4th-century Etchmiadzin Cathedral headquarters of the Armenian Church. Khor Virap Monastery is a pilgrimage site near Mount Ararat a dormant volcano just across the border in Turkey.","independent":1,"landmass_km":28470,"population_christian":2826000,"population_christian_percentage":97.9,"population_protestant_percentage":97.9,"population_refugee":17985,"population_migration":-4998,"population_year_change":0.19,"population_density_km":104,"population_average_age":35,"population_urban_percentage":63,"population_literacy_percentage":99,"region_code":5,"region_id":145,"region_name":"Western Asia","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Armenia","url_national_society":"https://biblesociety.am/arm/1/Main","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/bible-society-in-armenia/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/armenia/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/AM-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/ARM","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/armenia.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Asia/Armenia","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/armenia","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/armenia/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/AM","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/armenia.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/22048631","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Armenia_dload_hi.mov"}}
