As in the case of the Gutenberg Bible, the German edition contains no information about the printer or the date of printing. However, the analysis of the types used indicates that it was produced in the workshop of Johann Mentelin (circa 1410‒78) in Strasbourg. Furthermore, a handwritten note at the end of this copy provides a decisive clue as to the date of printing (folio 400 verso). Inscribed beneath the coats of arms of the book’s first owners, the Augsburg merchant and councilman Hektor Mülich (died 1489 or 1490) and his wife of patrician lineage, Ottilia Conzelmann (died 1467), a notice records the date and price of purchase: “This book was bought unbound for the price of 12 florins on 27 June 1466.” Its printing therefore must have been completed sometime before that date. As indicated in the inscription, the Bible was purchased unbound. The buyer himself must have arranged for the binding to be done. Prior to binding, the initial letters and captions were rubricated in red, blue, and green, and the book was decorated with painted initials and borders, probably the work of Mülich himself. The purchase of this book indicates that a supra-regional book market already existed in the 1460s, allowing customers in Augsburg to buy books from such far-away places of production as Strasbourg. The German-language Bible was one of the few books possessed by the wealthy Augsburg politician and historian, whose interests focused more on German-language literature than on early Augsburg humanism. Whether this edition of the Bible was really the oldest printed German Bible remained long unresolved, until finally, in 1787, the Munich court librarian Gerhoh Steigenberger was able to prove that another, also undated edition printed in Strasbourg by Heinrich Eggestein was nothing other than an almost-exact reprint of Mentelin’s edition with occasional omissions, thus settling the question of precedence.

This script is thought to have been invented around 350AD by the bishop Ulfilas for the purpose of translating the Bible into the Gothic language. The runic script which had previously been used for writing this language had strong associations with Germanic paganism, so was not deemed appropriate for this purpose. The Gothic language continued to be spoken until the 17th century, but there is no record of the script being used beyond the 6th century. </li> <li>Ulfilas based the Gothic script largely on an uncial form of the Greek alphabet, with some influence from the Runic and Latin scripts also. It was written from left to right, without spaces between words. Some texts were written with a space, dot or colon between phrases and others were <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#colom target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;<span class=Em>colometric</span></a>, with every distinctive clause starting on a new line. </li> <li>The script was comprised of twenty-seven letters.

European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US UK France and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations the EC which became the EU and NATO while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999 Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency the euro.","overview":"Germany is a Western European country with a landscape of forests rivers mountain ranges and North Sea beaches.
