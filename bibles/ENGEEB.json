We have used a basic vocabulary of 1200 well-known English words. It is a very good Bible for anyone who is learning English or speaks English as a foreign language.\n\nEasyEnglish Website: To help you even more, the EasyEnglish Bible website – www.easyenglish.bible – has Commentaries and Bible Studies to help you understand the message of the Bible and apply it to your life.\n\nTranslation Principles: To make the Bible as easy as possible to understand, we have used: Short sentences, Short paragraphs, Simple grammar. We have avoided things that can be hard to understand, so we have used: No passive verbs, No idioms, No split infinitives, No rhetorical questions. The EasyEnglish Bible is a “meaning-for-meaning” translation not a “word-for-word” translation.\n\nIt expresses the meaning of the original message in the most clear, accurate and natural way possible in simple English. It changes the order of words if that makes the meaning clearer in English. It translates the meaning of idioms rather than the literal words. It uses British spelling, grammar and punctuation. These translation principles have been developed by Wycliffe Bible Translators (WBT) and SIL.\n\nEasyEnglish Translation Team: The EasyEnglish Bible has been translated by MissionAssist, which is a Christian charity based in the United Kingdom. MissionAssist is part of the Wycliffe Global Alliance (WGA) and a member of Global Connections.\n\nThe EasyEnglish Bible translation team includes:\n\nLinguistic Checkers - People who check the linguistic consistency of the work. Our linguistic checkers normally have a degree in Linguistics or English (or similar) and a TEFL qualification.\nTheological Checkers - People who check the theological accuracy of the work. Our theological checkers have a degree in theology (or a similar qualification).\nStyle Checkers - People who check drafts and final output for accuracy, consistency and conformance to EasyEnglish principles.\nThe Base Text\nWe have used a range of English Bible translations as a base. Where English versions have a different understanding of the original text, we have referred to the Hebrew or Greek text, using the texts published and updated by United Bible Societies (UBS):\n\nOld Testament: Biblia Hebraica “Masoretic Text”\nNew Testament: The Nestle-Aland “Novum Testamentum Graece”\nWe also use the resources provided by Wycliffe Bible Translators to help translators and checkers understand the issues involved in translating the original texts.\n\nCopyright Information\nCopyright © MissionAssist 2018 – Charitable Incorporated Organisation 1162807\n\nThe copyright of the EasyEnglish Bible and all other material on this website is owned by MissionAssist.\n\nMissionAssist is a member of the Wycliffe Global Alliance and is based in the UK.\n\nMissionAssist, PO Box 257, Evesham, Worcestershire, England.

It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":null}
