The World English Bible came about in order to provide a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English that can provide unrestricted free posting on the internet and also be freely copied without written permission from the publisher and payment of royalties. No other Bible is thus available and this is the vacuum that the World English Bible is filling. Under the guidance of Rainbow Missions, Inc., a Colorado nonprofit corporation, scores of volunteer translators, editors and proofreaders have produced the WEB. The World English Bible is an update of the American Standard Version of 1901, which is in the public domain. The WEB revision is also in the public domain, which sets it apart from other revisions of the American Standard Version, like the New American Standard Bible and the Revised Standard Version. There is also the World English Bible: Messianic Edition that substitutes traditional Hebrew names and phrases for the equivalent Greek/English names and phrases.<br>The World English Bible is in the public domain.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Latn","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"US","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-0218-4","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/eng-WEB","title":"BibleSearch","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":"american-bible-society","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/eng-WEBBE","title":"BibleSearch (British)","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":"american-bible-society","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"http://amzn.to/1PnTEqA","title":"Amazon Marketplace","scope":null,"type":"print","provider":"Amazon Marketplace","organization_id":null,"filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"https://www.ebible.org/buy.htm","title":"Kahunapule Inc.","scope":null,"type":"print","provider":"eBible","organization_id":"ebible","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"http://amzn.to/2hgnuQ0","title":"JHN, 1JN, 2JN, 3JN","scope":null,"type":"print","provider":"Amazon Marketplace","organization_id":null,"filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/ENGWWH/MAT/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=235&lang=53","title":"World English Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Bible Gateway","organization_id":"bible-gateway","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"app","url":"https://apk.fcbh.org/English_Full_WEB","title":"Global Bible App","scope":null,"type":"app","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"app","url":"https://apk.fcbh.org/English_NT_WEB","title":"Global Bible App","scope":null,"type":"app","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/bible/world-english-bible/","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"New Christian Bible Study","organization_id":null,"filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ENGWEB","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"audio_web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ENGWEB","title":"NT","scope":null,"type":"audio_web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/206-web-world-english-bible","title":"World English Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":"FBD","bible_link_type":"archive","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=9879dbb7cfe39e4d","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":null,"type":"archive","provider":"Digital Bible Library","organization_id":"digital-bible-library","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGWEB","bible_size_id":"NT","bible_link_type":"archiveaudio","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=105a06b6146d11e7","title":"English -

It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[{"id":"ENGWEBB","parent_bible_id":"ENGWEB","gbc":null,"date":"2015","iso":"eng","title":"World English British Edition","title_vernacular":"World English Bible British Edition","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"The World English Bible British Edition is a Public Domain translation of the Holy Bible into contemporary British/International English.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Latn","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GB","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-0227-6","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ENGWEBBM","parent_bible_id":"ENGWEB","gbc":null,"date":"2016","iso":"eng","title":"World English Bible - British Messianic","title_vernacular":"World Messianic Bible British Edition","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ENGWEBC","parent_bible_id":"ENGWEB","gbc":null,"date":"2015","iso":"eng","title":"World English Catholic Edition","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":2,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"US","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ENGWEBM","parent_bible_id":"ENGWEB","gbc":null,"date":"2016","iso":"eng","title":"World English Bible - Messianic","title_vernacular":"World Messianic Bible","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ENGWEBMA","parent_bible_id":"ENGWEB","gbc":null,"date":"2015","iso":"eng","title":"World English Messianic American Edition","title_vernacular":"World English Messianic Bible","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"The World Messianic Bible American Edition is a Public Domain translation of the Holy Bible into modern English as spoken among Messianic Jews outside of the United States of America.

During the 19th and 20th centuries 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states and the Great Depression of the 1930s an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991 the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II the economy has achieved relatively steady growth low unemployment and inflation and rapid advances in technology.","overview":"'The U.S. is a country of 50 states covering a vast swath of North America with Alaska in the northwest and Hawaii extending the nation’s presence into the Pacific Ocean.
