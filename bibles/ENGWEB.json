{"abbr":"ENGWEB","title":"World English Bible (2000)","title_vernacular":"World English Bible","description":"The World English Bible (WEB) is an English translation of the Bible published in 2000. The World English Bible came about in order to provide a complete translation of the Holy Bible in normal modern English that can provide unrestricted free posting on the internet and also be freely copied without written permission from the publisher and payment of royalties. No other Bible is thus available and this is the vacuum that the World English Bible is filling. Under the guidance of Rainbow Missions, Inc., a Colorado nonprofit corporation, scores of volunteer translators, editors and proofreaders have produced the WEB. The World English Bible is an update of the American Standard Version of 1901, which is in the public domain. The WEB revision is also in the public domain, which sets it apart from other revisions of the American Standard Version, like the New American Standard Bible and the Revised Standard Version. There is also the World English Bible: Messianic Edition that substitutes traditional Hebrew names and phrases for the equivalent Greek/English names and phrases.\u003cbr\u003eThe World English Bible is in the public domain.","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":2000,"country_id":"US","copyright":"Public Domain","copyright_type":"OPEN","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/eng-WEB","title":"BibleSearch","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"American Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"0c51d6dd-1184-4288-8ead-6b34349693a4"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/eng-WEBBE","title":"BibleSearch (British)","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"American Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"0c51d6dd-1184-4288-8ead-6b34349693a4"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"http://amzn.to/1PnTEqA","title":"Amazon Marketplace","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Amazon Marketplace","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://www.ebible.org/buy.htm","title":"Kahunapule Inc.","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"eBible","visible":true,"organization_id":"583342a6-6914-4401-b670-83924dd3a1ae"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"http://amzn.to/2hgnuQ0","title":"JHN, 1JN, 2JN, 3JN","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Amazon Marketplace","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/ENGWWH/MAT/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo\u0026vid=235\u0026lang=53","title":"World English Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible Gateway","visible":true,"organization_id":"9696ef31-b54c-4a20-82ab-f1b8a527e48a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://apk.fcbh.org/English_Full_WEB","title":"Global Bible App","scope":"","type":"app","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://apk.fcbh.org/English_NT_WEB","title":"Global Bible App","scope":"","type":"app","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/bible/world-english-bible/","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"New Christian Bible Study","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ENGWEB","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ENGWEB","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"audio_web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/206-web-world-english-bible","title":"World English Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=9879dbb7cfe39e4d","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":"FBD","type":"archive","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWEB","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=105a06b6146d11e7","title":"English -

During the 19th and 20th centuries 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states and the Great Depression of the 1930s an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991 the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II the economy has achieved relatively steady growth low unemployment and inflation and rapid advances in technology.","overview":"'The U.S. is a country of 50 states covering a vast swath of North America with Alaska in the northwest and Hawaii extending the nation’s presence into the Pacific Ocean. Major Atlantic Coast cities are New York a global finance and culture center and capital Washington DC. Midwestern metropolis Chicago is known for influential architecture and on the west coast Los Angeles'' Hollywood is famed for filmmaking.'","independent":1,"landmass_km":9147420,"population_christian":213000000,"population_christian_percentage":65,"population_catholic_percentage":20,"population_protestant_percentage":45,"population_refugee":341711,"population_migration":954806,"population_year_change":0.59,"population_density_km":36,"population_average_age":38,"population_urban_percentage":83,"population_literacy_percentage":99,"region_code":12,"region_id":21,"region_name":"Northern America","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States","url_national_society":"http://www.americanbible.org/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/american-bible-society/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/united-states/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/US-summary.pdf","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/united_states.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/North_America/United_States","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/united-states-of-america","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/US","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/usa.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/23173134","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=USA_dload_hi.mov"}}
