{"abbr":"LATPASS","title":"Passau Gospel","title_vernacular":"Passau Evangelia","description":"This manuscript Gospel book is believed to have been produced around 1150 in Passau, Germany. This codex and the Gospel of Passau (also in the World Digital Library) are outstanding manuscripts, isolated within the manuscript production of that time and place. The Gospel book opens with eight pages of canon tables, which are very elaborate. Four full-page pictures of the sitting Evangelists appear as three-dimensional. In the 15th century the work was bound in covers of gold-plated brass. The front cover is dominated by the figure of Madonna on the throne; her head is made from rock crystal. In the corners of the front cover were added medallions with the symbols of the Evangelists engraved below glass. The manuscript belonged to the monastery of Saint Nicholas in Passau and was transferred to Munich in 1803 or 1804.

In 1870 the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East sexual misconduct by clergy international development interreligious dialogue and reconciliation and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1.2 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith.","overview":"'Vatican City a city-state surrounded by Rome Italy is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.
