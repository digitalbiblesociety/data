Tischendorf devoted his life to locating the most accurate sources for the compilation of the Greek New Testament. This desire for the earliest, most reliable manuscripts drove him for most of his life. The result of this drive is Tischendorf's Eighth Edition Greek New Testament, completed just two years prior to his death, and considered by many to be his best.\n","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Latn","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-0262-7","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"GRCTISH","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://ebible.org/find/details.php?id=grctis","title":"Simple HTML Bibles","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"ebible.org","organization_id":"ebible","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"GRCTISH","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/GRCTISH_DBS_HS/Greek-(1877)-Tischendorf-Novum-Testamentum-(8th-edition).pdf","title":"Greek (1877) Tischendorf Novum Testamentum (8th edition)","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Archive","organization_id":"archive-bible","filesize":66038240,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"GRCTISH","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"study","url":"http://downloads.dbs.org/archive/Greek-(1896)-Tischendorf-Novem-Testamentum-(Vol.-1-9)-7th-and-8th-(Study-Bible)-NT.pdf","title":"Greek (1896) Tischendorf Novem Testamentum (Vol. 1-9) 7th and 8th (Study Bible) NT","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Archive","organization_id":"archive-bible","filesize":296602646,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"GRCTISH","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/GRCTISH_DBS_HS/Greek-English-(1864)-New-Testament-Emphatic-Diaglot.pdf","title":"Greek-English (1864) New Testament Emphatic Diaglot","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Archive","organization_id":"archive-bible","filesize":66219431,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"GRCTISH","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/GRCTISH_DBS_HS/Greek-English-(1897)-Interlinear-Literal-Translation-Greek-New-Testament.pdf","title":"Greek-English (1897) Interlinear Literal Translation - Greek New Testament","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Archive","organization_id":"archive-bible","filesize":76336059,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"GRCTISH","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/GRCTISH_DBS_HS/Greek-(1872)-Tischendorf-Novum-Testamentum-(8th-Edition)-(book).pdf","title":"Greek (1872) Tischendorf Novum Testamentum (8th Edition) (Book)","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Archive","organization_id":"archive-bible","filesize":1414991,"response_code":null}],"pod":[],"alphabet":{"script":"Latn","name":"Latin","unicode_pdf":null,"family":"European","type":"alphabet","white_space":"between words","open_type_tag":"latn","complex_positioning":"yes","requires_font":false,"unicode":true,"diacritics":true,"contextual_forms":false,"reordering":false,"case":null,"split_graphs":false,"status":"Current","baseline":"bottom","ligatures":"optional","direction":"ltr","direction_notes":null,"sample":null,"sample_img":null,"description":"<p>The Latin script (also called the Roman script) is the most widely used writing system in the world, being the script of the English language, spoken by over 300,000,000 people worldwide. It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","macroarea":null,"level":"H","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GR","latitude":"39.815500","longitude":"21.912930","population":0,"status_id":"10","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"GR","name":"Greece","name_long":"The Hellenic Republic","population":10569703,"official_language":"Greek","official_language_iso":"ell","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"GR","iso_a3":"GRC","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":300,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century it gradually added neighboring islands and territories most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949 Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967 a group of military officers seized power establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981 Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late 2009 due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities. Since 2010 Greece has entered three bailout agreements with the European Commission the European Central Bank (ECB) the IMF and with the third the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The Greek Government agreed to its current $96 billion bailout in August 2015 which will conclude in August 2018.","overview":"'Greece is a country in southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas.
