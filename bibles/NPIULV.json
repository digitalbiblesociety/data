The script is used for over 120 spoken Indo-Aryan languages, including Hindi, Nepali, Marathi, Maithili, Awadhi, Newari and Bhojpuri. It is also used for writing Classical Sanskrit texts. Generally the orthography of the script reflects the pronunciation of the language.</p> <p>The script is written from left to right. Letters hang from a headstroke, which is generally continuous throughout the length of the word, except when writing the letters <span class=Em>jha</span>, <span class=Em>tha</span>, <span class=Em>dha</span>, <span class=Em>bha</span>, <span class=Em>a</span> and <span class=Em>ā</span>, which all have a break in the headstroke. In handwriting, the headstroke is sometimes omitted.</p> <p>Devanagari is an abugida; each letter represents a consonant with an inherent ə vowel, which can be modified using vowel diacritics. Vowel diacritics can be written above, below, to the left or to the right of the consonant. There are thirty-two consonant and ten vowel letters, plus ten vowel diacritics. The vowel signs represent long and short forms of five vowel sounds. Vowel sounds which are not preceded by a consonant are written with a vowel letter; otherwise they are indicated by a vowel diacritic, or, in the case of ə, the lack thereof. There are also two letters for the long and short forms of the syllabic consonant r̩, which are ordered with the vowel letters.</p> <p>The Brahmic scripts are known for ordering the letters according to the principles of articulatory phonetics, that is, according to the place and manner in which the sound is produced. In Devanagari, the vowels are ordered first, with each short vowel followed by its long equivalent. The consonants are ordered by place, and within place, manner of articulation. Consonants are ordered in rows; velar, palatal, retroflex, dental, labial. Within each row, they follow the order unaspirated and aspirated voiceless, unaspirated and aspirated voiced, and nasal. Sonorants, fricatives and sibilants are ordered last.</p> <p>Some letters take variant forms depending on their context. Notably, the letter <span class=Em>ra</span> takes different forms when in initial/final position, when preceding the letter <span class=Em>ya</span>, when preceding a consonant other than <span class=Em>ya</span>, when following a consonant with a vertical stem, and when following a letter with a rounded bottom.</p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/m4/8t/m48txu8ufx_DevanagariRA.png height=242 width=270 /></p> <p>Most consonants have two forms; a full form and a half form, which often visually resembles the full form but is missing the vertical stem. The half forms can combine with the full forms of other letters to represent consonant clusters. Those letters which dont have a half form make use of a <span class=Em>halant</span> symbol which silences the inherent vowel so that the two consonants can be pronounced in sequence. Some combinations join horizontally and some stack vertically. This is generally governed by the shape of the letter. A number of ligatures (commonly called <span class=Em>conjuncts</span> when referring to Indic scripts) are also used which do not bear visual similarity to the individual letters of which they are comprised.</p> <p>Devanagari writing employs three non-alphabetic symbols for modifying the quality of a vowel. <span class=Em>Anusvara</span> is written with a dot above the vowel and either nasalizes the vowel or represents a nasal consonant articulated at the same place as the following consonant. A variant form of this symbol is called <span class=Em>candrabindu</span> and is written with a moon dot above the letter to represent nasalization of the vowel exclusively. The symbol <span class=Em>visarga</span> follows <span class=Em>anusvara</span>; this symbol represents a voiceless breath following the vowel, and is written with two dots stacked vertically.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"npi","glotto_id":"nepa1254","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Nepali","autonym":" Nepalese","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Bhutan","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"NP","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"population":24720300,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"NP","name":"Nepal","name_long":"The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal","population":30424878,"official_language":"Nepali","official_language_iso":"npi","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"NP","iso_a3":"NPL","continent_id":"AS","iso_num":524,"religion_primary":"Hinduism","introduction":"During the late 18th-early 19th centuries the principality of Gorkha united many of the other principalities and states of the sub-Himalayan region into a Nepalese Kingdom. Nepal retained its independence following the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16 and the subsequent peace treaty laid the foundations for two centuries of amicable relations between Britain and Nepal. (The Brigade of Gurkas continues to serve in the British Army to the present day.) In 1951 the Nepali monarch ended the century-old system of rule by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system that brought political parties into the government. That arrangement lasted until 1960 when political parties were again banned but was reinstated in 1990 with the establishment of a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. ++ An insurgency led by Maoists broke out in 1996. The ensuing 10-year civil war between Maoist and government forces witnessed the dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and the re-assumption of absolute power by the king in 2002. A peace accord in 2006 led to the promulgation of an interim constitution in 2007. Following a nationwide Constituent Assembly (CA) election in 2008 the newly formed CA declared Nepal a federal democratic republic abolished the monarchy and elected the country's first president. After the CA failed to draft a constitution by a May 2012 deadline set by the Supreme Court then-Prime Minister Baburam BHATTARAI dissolved the CA. Months of negotiations ensued until March 2013 when the major political parties agreed to create an interim government headed by then-Chief Justice Khil Raj REGMI with a mandate to hold elections for a new CA. Elections were held in November 2013 in which the Nepali Congress won the largest share of seats in the CA and in February 2014 formed a coalition government with the second place Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist-Leninist and with Nepali Congress President Sushil KOIRALA as prime minister. Nepal's new constitution came into effect in September 2015.","overview":"Nepal officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal is a landlocked country in South Asia located mainly in the Himalayas but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":143,"land_mass_km":143350,"population_christian":269000,"population_christian_percentage":0.9,"population_catholic_percentage":0.1,"population_protestant_percentage":0.8,"population_refugee":19574,"population_migration":41710,"population_year_change":1.85,"population_density_km":203,"population_average_age":25,"population_urban_percentage":21,"population_literacy_percentage":"85.00","landmass":null,"region_code":4,"region_id":"34","region_name":"Southern Asia"}}
