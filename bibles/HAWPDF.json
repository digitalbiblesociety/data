    "description": "Ka Baibala Hemolele: The Hawaiian Bible, first published in 1839, was translated from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Ka Baibala Hemolele (2018) is a presentation of the Hawaiian Bible in the modern Hawaiian orthography. This includes two additional characters: the ‘okina (glottal stop) – a consonant which was left out of the original set of letters that made up the Hawaiian alphabet in 1826, and the kahakō – a macron used to mark elongated vowels. The sounds represented by these two characters were always present in the language but previously unwritten. Quotation marks were added to the text to improve readability and comprehension. Ka Baibala Hemolele is an accurate and faithful translation of the Holy Scripture, from the original languages, in the modern Hawaiian orthography",
