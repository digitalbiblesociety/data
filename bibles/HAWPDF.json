{"abbr":"HAWPDF","title":"Ka Baibala Hemolele Hawaiian Bible","title_vernacular":"Ka Baibala Hemolele","description":"Ka Baibala Hemolele: The Hawaiian Bible, first published in 1839, was translated from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Ka Baibala Hemolele (2018) is a presentation of the Hawaiian Bible in the modern Hawaiian orthography. This includes two additional characters: the ‘okina (glottal stop) – a consonant which was left out of the original set of letters that made up the Hawaiian alphabet in 1826, and the kahakō – a macron used to mark elongated vowels. The sounds represented by these two characters were always present in the language but previously unwritten. Quotation marks were added to the text to improve readability and comprehension. Ka Baibala Hemolele is an accurate and faithful translation of the Holy Scripture, from the original languages, in the modern Hawaiian orthography","iso":"haw","script":"Latn","year":1839,"country_id":"US","copyright":"© Partners Development Foundation, 2018.","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"HAWPDF","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/2709-kbh-ka-baibala-hemolele","title":"Ka Baibala Hemolele","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Partners in Development Foundation","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"HAWPDF","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=311c4f90d32e3299","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":"FB","type":"archive","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a"},{"bible_abbr":"HAWPDF","url":"https://archive.org/download/HAWPDF_DBS_HS/Hawaiian-English-(1859)-Diglot-New-Testament.pdf","title":"Hawaiian-English (1859) Diglot New Testament","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"44257069","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"},{"bible_abbr":"HAWPDF","url":"https://bible.com/versions/2709","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"HAWPDF","organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a","equivalent_id":"311c4f90d32e3299","site":"","suffix":"","type":"DBL","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=311c4f90d32e3299"},{"bible_abbr":"HAWPDF","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"2709","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/2709"}],"language":{"iso":"haw","glotto_id":"hawa1245","name":"Hawaiian","autonym":"ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi","level":"L","location":"United States of America, Alaska and Hawaii","area":"Hawaiian Islands, mainly Ni’ihau Island, Island of Hawai’i, some on all other islands.","country_id":"US","latitude":19.62965,"longitude":-155.42995,"population":2000,"status_id":"2"},"country":{"id":"US","name":"United States","name_long":"The United States of America","population":334998398,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"USA","continent_id":"NA","iso_num":840,"language_count":506,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states and the Great Depression of the 1930s an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991 the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II the economy has achieved relatively steady growth low unemployment and inflation and rapid advances in technology.","overview":"'The U.S. is a country of 50 states covering a vast swath of North America with Alaska in the northwest and Hawaii extending the nation’s presence into the Pacific Ocean. Major Atlantic Coast cities are New York a global finance and culture center and capital Washington DC.
