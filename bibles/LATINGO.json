{"abbr":"LATINGO","title":"Ingolstadt Gospel Book - Illuminated","title_vernacular":"Ingolstadii Liber Evangelicus","description":"The so-called Ingolstadt Gospel Book shares the fate of many other liturgical manuscripts, which over time gradually lost their status as religious objects and came to be reused for profane purposes. Only a fraction of the formerly 260−80 folios of this sumptuous manuscript from the middle of the ninth century have survived. Most of its pages were used in bindings of account books in the 17th and 19th centuries. One double leaf was in the possession of the German painter Carl Spitzweg in the 19th century. When and why the Gospel book was disassembled and the circumstances under which it reached Ingolstadt are uncertain. The manuscript was created at Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria. It is written in uncial script with decorated initials that are slightly unusual for the Mondsee School and which seem to be influenced by the Insular style of illumination (e.g., folio 18a recto). Besides the texts of the Gospels, 10 pages with canon tables are preserved.

In 1870 the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East sexual misconduct by clergy international development interreligious dialogue and reconciliation and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1.2 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith.","overview":"'Vatican City a city-state surrounded by Rome Italy is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.
