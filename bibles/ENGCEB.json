It’s uncommon in that it’s the newest translation by the largest number of biblical scholars & church leaders in words 21st century readers use every day, aligning academic rigor with modern understandability, proven through extensive affirmation with, and acting on feedback from, hundreds of readers. The new Common English Bible is the only translation to combine and balance highly respected ecumenical biblical scholarship necessary for serious study with responsiveness to 21st century clear communication requirements for comprehensive clarity.<br>The Common English Bible is the result of collaboration between opposites: scholars working with average readers; conservatives working with liberals; teens working with retirees; men working with women; many denominations and many ethnicities coming together around the common goal of creating a translation that unites rather than divides, with the ultimate goal of mutually accomplishing God’s overall work in the world.<br>Combining scholarly accuracy with vivid language, the Common English Bible is the work of 120 biblical scholars from 24 denominations in American, African, Asian, European, and Latino communities, representing such academic institutions as Asbury Theological Seminary, Azusa Pacific University, Bethel Seminary, Denver Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, Seattle Pacific University, Wheaton College, Yale University, and many others. They meticulously translated the Bible into English directly from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.<br>Additionally, more than 500 readers in 77 groups field-tested the translation. Every verse was read aloud in the reading groups, where potentially confusing passages were identified. The translators considered the groups' responses and, where necessary, reworked those passages to clarify in English their meaning from the original languages. In total, more than 600 people worked jointly to bring the Common English Bible to fruition.<br>In 2010 the New Testament was published. In 2011 the complete Bible was published with the Old Testament and the availability of the Apocrypha.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"ENGCEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"http://amzn.to/1TFEhIp","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"print","provider":"Amazon Marketplace","organization_id":null,"filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGCEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://www.commonenglishbible.com/explore/downloads","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"CommonEnglishBible.com","organization_id":null,"filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGCEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/Common-English-Bible-CEB/#vinfo","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"BibleGateway","organization_id":"bible-gateway","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGCEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=105&lang=53","title":"Common English Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Bible Gateway","organization_id":"bible-gateway","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGCEB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/37-ceb-common-english-bible","title":"Common English Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Common English Bible","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null}],"pod":[],"alphabet":{"script":"Latn","name":"Latin","unicode_pdf":null,"family":"European","type":"alphabet","white_space":"between words","open_type_tag":"latn","complex_positioning":"yes","requires_font":false,"unicode":true,"diacritics":true,"contextual_forms":false,"reordering":false,"case":null,"split_graphs":false,"status":"Current","baseline":"bottom","ligatures":"optional","direction":"ltr","direction_notes":null,"sample":null,"sample_img":null,"description":"<p>The Latin script (also called the Roman script) is the most widely used writing system in the world, being the script of the English language, spoken by over 300,000,000 people worldwide. It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":null}
