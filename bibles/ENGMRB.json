    "description": "This bulky octavo- Volume with XIV & 1734 pp brings the Scripture text constructed specially for this work, for which the editor is solely responsible. It is based upon the The English Revised Version (1885), with choice between the readings of the text and margin, and such slight changes of wording as are involved in the adaption to modern literary structure. The reference figures in the outer margin are to the chapters and verses of the RV. Texts are in single and double column, depending on the importance which Moulton sets up. Poetical books are printed in colometric text form.<br>Moulton wrote a six-paged preface dated June 1907 wherein he unfolds his general ideas about how to present the venerable Scriptures to modern man.",
