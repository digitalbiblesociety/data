    "description": "Kenzi or Kenuzi, also known as Mattokki, is a Nubian language from southern Egypt. It is related to other Nubian languages spoken in the Sudan.  Nubian Kenuzi Gospels The Gospel (Enjil Yesu) in the Kenzi (Kenuzi) dialect of Nubian was translated by Mohammed (known as Samuel after his baptism) Ali Hisên from Fichikôl in Abuhôr. He was a Nubian evangelist in the service of the German Sudan Pioneer Mission. The translation was done under the supervision of Heinrich Schäfer, a professor in the Egyptian Department of the Royal Museum, Berlin who gently edited and revised it.  The 4 Gospel accounts were prepared in Roman script. Matthew was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Hiran Mata Bajsin Nawite. Mark was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Hiran Markus Bajsin Nawite. Luke was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Luka Gadisebul Bajsin Nawite. John was entitled: Enjil Yesu Komisbuldi Teran Hiran Hana Bajsin Nawite. They were each printed separately in 1912.  The Gospel booklets each come with a four-page explanatory leaflet called in German: Für europäische Leser (for European readers). This explains the orthography used, how the characters represent sounds, and how they related to characters in the Arabic alphabet. This was dated November 1912 and written by Heinrich Schäfer in Berlin. The Gospel booklets were printed by Trowitzsch amp Sohn of Berlin SW for the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) in Berlin in 1912. These four Gospels were digitised for the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), in 2019, from originals in their library at Cambridge. The 4 Gospels were combined into one digital product. ",
