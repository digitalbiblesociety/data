The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot Austro-Hungarian Empire which collapsed during World War I. The country fell under communist rule following World War II. In 1956 a revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership of Janos KADAR in 1968 Hungary began liberalizing its economy introducing so-called \\\"Goulash Communism.\\\" Hungary held its first multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It joined NATO in 1999 and the EU five years later.","overview":"Hungary is a landlocked country in Central Europe. Its capital Budapest is bisected by the Danube River. Its cityscape is studded with architectural landmarks from Buda’s medieval Castle Hill and grand neoclassical buildings along Pest’s Andrássy Avenue to the 19th-century Chain Bridge. Turkish and Roman influence on Hungarian culture includes the popularity of mineral spas including at thermal Lake Hévíz.","independent":1,"landmass_km":90530,"population_christian":6501000,"population_christian_percentage":65,"population_catholic_percentage":58,"population_protestant_percentage":13.91,"population_refugee":5772,"population_migration":6000,"population_year_change":-0.25,"population_density_km":107,"population_average_age":43,"population_urban_percentage":72,"population_literacy_percentage":99,"region_code":9,"region_id":151,"region_name":"Eastern Europe","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Hungary","url_national_society":"http://bibliatarsulat.hu/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/hungarian-bible-society/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/hungary/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/HU-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/HUN","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/hungary.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Europe/Hungary","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/hungary","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/hungary/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/HU","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/hungary.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/22348669","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Hungary2_dload_hi.mp4"}}
