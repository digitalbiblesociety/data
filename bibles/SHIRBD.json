In the 16th century the Sa'adi monarchy particularly under Ahmad al-MANSUR (1578-1603) repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age. The Alaouite Dynasty to which the current Moroccan royal family belongs dates from the 17th century. In 1860 Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912 the French imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V the current monarch's grandfather organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of king. Since Spain's 1976 withdrawal from what is today called Western Sahara Morocco has extended its de facto administrative control to roughly 80% of this territory; however the UN does not recognize Morocco as the administering power for Western Sahara. The UN since 1991 has monitored a cease-fire between Morocco and the Polisario Front - Western Sahara's liberation movement - and leads ongoing negotiations over the status of the territory. ++ King MOHAMMED VI in early 2011 responded to the spread of pro-democracy protests in the region by implementing a reform program that included a new constitution passed by popular referendum in July 2011 under which some new powers were extended to parliament and the prime minister but ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch. In November 2011 the Justice and Development Party (PJD) - a moderate Islamist party - won the largest number of seats in parliamentary elections becoming the first Islamist party to lead the Moroccan Government. In September 2015 Morocco held its first ever direct elections for regional councils one of the reforms included in the 2011 constitution. The PJD again won the largest number of seats in nationwide parliamentary elections in October 2016.","overview":"Morocco a North African country bordering the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea is distinguished by its Berber Arabian and European cultural influences.
