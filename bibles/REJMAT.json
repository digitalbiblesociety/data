The script is thought to pre-date the introduction of Islam in the C12th to the area, although the earliest attested document has been dated to the mid C18th. It is traditionally written on bamboo, buffalo horn, bark or copper plates. An abugida of Brahmic derivation, the script comprises 23 consonant letters each with an inherent a vowel. Any of 12 diacritics can be used to modify the quality of the vowel. A further diacritic is used to mute the inherent vowel in a consonant-final syllable. The script is somewhat <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#defect target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;defective</a> in that it does not allow for the representation of diphthongs, which occur frequently in spoken Rejang. Consonants likewise cannot form clusters.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"rej","glotto_id":"reja1240","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Rejang","autonym":"Baso Jang  Baso Hejang","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Indonesia, Sumatra","area":"North Bengkulu Province, southwest highlands, Arga Makmur, Muara Aman, Curup, Kapahiang areas; South Sumatra Province, Musi Rawa Ulu.","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"ID","latitude":"-3.330560","longitude":"102.433590","population":350000,"status_id":"6a","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":null}
