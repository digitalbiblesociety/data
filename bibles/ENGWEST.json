    "description": "The Westminster Version of the Sacred Scriptures was produced by Roman Catholics in England. The New Testament was produced in four volumes with parts of each volume appearing as separate fascicles between 1913 and 1935. The New Testament was completed in 1936 and portions of the Old Testament appeared in the 1940s and 50s. The General Editors were Cuthbert Lattey (1877-1954) and Joseph Keating (1865-1939).<br><br>No additional portions of the Old Testament were published after Cuthbert Lattey's death in 1954. A complete Bible with the New Testament and Psalms in the Westminster Version and the remainder in the Challoner's revision of the Douay-Rheims Version was printed in 1958 and again in 1966.",
