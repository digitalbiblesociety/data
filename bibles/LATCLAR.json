{"abbr":"LATCLAR","title":"Claricia Psalter","title_vernacular":"Claricia Psalterium","description":"The Claricia Psalter was made for, and most likely by, a group of Benedictine nuns at the abbey of Saints Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg, Germany. Although the psalter itself, along with its calendar, dates to the late-12th or early 13th century, a number of texts and prayers were added in the mid-13th century. Most striking about the manuscript are its illuminations, which include a prefatory cycle, full-page miniatures, and historiated initials. While all are Romanesque in style, they vary greatly in quality and technique, and three or four different artists seem to have been at work. The psalter takes its name from one of the initials, which depicts a young girl in secular dress swinging from the initial \"Q,\" who has \"Claricia\" written around her head. It has been suggested that the image represents a novice artist who signed her work, but there are many other theories, none of which is certain.

In 1870 the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East sexual misconduct by clergy international development interreligious dialogue and reconciliation and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1.2 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith.","overview":"'Vatican City a city-state surrounded by Rome Italy is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.
