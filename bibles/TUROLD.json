It is stored in the Leiden University Library (ms. Or. 1101a-f). Ali Bey's Old Testament Apocrypha from the same manuscript has been published online by Kadir Akın. The date 1666 that is often cited confuses Ali Bey's manuscript with the Turkish New Testament of William Seaman, printed at Oxford later in 1666, whereas Ali Bey's manuscript was finished by the end of 1665.\n\nAmong the Bibles printed later, the closest to Ali Bey's translation are the first four chapters of Genesis in a booklet printed by N. Schroeder in 1739, and the New Testament edited by J.D. Kieffer and printed in Paris in 1819. The Old Testament in the Turkish Bible of 1827 is also quite close to Ali Bey, often word for word, but the New Testament was heavily edited by Kieffer.\n\nAli Bey's first draft, translated over three years from 1662 to 1664, is preserved in Leiden along with the secretarial copies. During the course of 1665 he supervised two secretaries and proofread their copies of his draft manuscript.\n\nA different \"fair copy,\" also from 1665, is archived in the Amsterdam University Library; another in Ali Bey's own hand is kept there as well, but the New Testament is missing and the Old Testament is incomplete.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"TUROLD","bible_size_id":"OT","bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://osmanlicakelam.net/en/texts","title":"Ali Bey'in el Yazmasi","scope":"FB","type":"web","provider":"Osmanlica Kelam","organization_id":null,"filesize":null,"response_code":null}],"pod":[],"alphabet":{"script":"Latn","name":"Latin","unicode_pdf":null,"family":"European","type":"alphabet","white_space":"between words","open_type_tag":"latn","complex_positioning":"yes","requires_font":false,"unicode":true,"diacritics":true,"contextual_forms":false,"reordering":false,"case":null,"split_graphs":false,"status":"Current","baseline":"bottom","ligatures":"optional","direction":"ltr","direction_notes":null,"sample":null,"sample_img":null,"description":"<p>The Latin script (also called the Roman script) is the most widely used writing system in the world, being the script of the English language, spoken by over 300,000,000 people worldwide. It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"tur","glotto_id":"nucl1301","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"tr","name":"Turkish","autonym":"Türkçe","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cyprus","area":"Widespread in Turkey as L1 or L2.
