island with its fine natural harbor at Castries was contested between England and France throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times); it was finally ceded to the UK in 1814. Even after the abolition of slavery on its plantations in 1834 Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops. Self-government was granted in 1967 and independence in 1979.","overview":"Saint Lucia is an Eastern Caribbean island nation with a pair of dramatically tapered mountains the Pitons on its west coast. Its coast is home to volcanic beaches reef-diving sites luxury resorts and fishing villages. Trails in the interior rainforest lead to waterfalls like the 15m-high Toraille which pours over a cliff into a garden. The capital Castries is a popular cruise port.","independent":1,"landmass_km":610,"population_year_change":0.46,"population_density_km":301,"population_average_age":34,"population_urban_percentage":19,"population_literacy_percentage":95,"region_code":12,"region_id":419,"region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Saint-Lucia","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/saint-lucia/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/ST-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/LCA","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/saint_lucia.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Caribbean/Saint_Lucia","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/saint-lucia","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/saint-lucia/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/LC","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/saint-lucia.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/79315475","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Saint_Lucia_dload_hi.mp4"}}
