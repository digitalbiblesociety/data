It is also used in Orissa for transcribing Sanskrit texts. The earliest inscriptions in the Odia language have been dated to 1051 AD, written in the Kalinga script from which modern Odia writing is derived.</p> <p>Like the other Brahmic scripts used in India, the Odia script is written from left to right and is based on the orthographic syllable called <span class=Em>akṣara</span>. An <span class=Em>akṣara</span> represents either a lone vowel or a consonant with a vowel attached. Each vowel sound can be written with one of two letters; used at the beginning of a word it is written with an independent vowel letter, but when it follows a consonant it is written with a dependent vowel diacritic which attaches above, below, beside or flanking both sides of the consonant letter. Consonant letters inherently contain a following ɔ vowel (transcribed <span class=Em>a</span>) unless they are modified with a vowel diacritic indicating a different vowel, or a <span class=Em>halanta</span> symbol silencing the vowel entirely.</p> <p>Consonant clusters can be written in several ways. Some combinations use a special non-decomposable ligature, or <span class=Em>conjunct</span>, for example <span class=Em>jnya</span>. Others are written using the <span class=Em>halanta</span> symbol to silence the vowel in the first member of the cluster. Alternatively, clusters can be written using half- or joining forms of all but one letter in the cluster. In some cases the first member is reduced to a half-form and attached to the second, for example in the cluster <span class=Em>dbha</span>; in other cases the second member is reduced and attached to the first, as in <span class=Em>dgha</span>. The orthographic syllable does not necessarily correspond to the phonological syllable in words containing consonant clusters.</p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/ew/p9/ewp9cjrm6j_OriyaConjuncts.png height=124 width=400 /></p> <p>Ligatures composed of an independent vowel and a consonant are generally not used, with the exception of the letter <span class=Em>wa</span> which is a combination of <span class=Em>o</span> and <span class=Em>ba</span> and is sometimes used for writing the sound w in loan words.</p> <p>The script is largely phonetic, that is, the pronunciation of a word can be deduced from its spelling, but there are a few phonological processes that alter the sound of a written letter. For example, the letters <span class=Em>da</span> and <span class=Em>d<sup>h</sup>a</span> are pronounced as ɽ ɽ<sup>h</sup> respectively when used between two vowels. A subscript dot is often written below the letter to indicate this change. So the word Odia is written <span class=Em>o</span> + (<span class=Em>da</span> + <span class=Em>dot</span> + <span class=Em>i diacritic</span>) + <span class=Em>a</span>.</p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/ew/p9/ewp9cjrm6j_OriyaOriya.png height=49 width=85 /></p> <p>As with many of the Brahmic scripts, the <span class=Em>anusvara</span> symbol can be used to indicate a nasal pronounced at the same place of articulation as the following stop, as in the cluster ŋkɔ, when written <span class=Em>anusvara</span> + <span class=Em>ka</span>. However, these clusters can also be written using special conjunct letters; a distinct letter also exists for representing the sound ŋkɔ.</p> <p>There is one script-specific punctuation mark, <span class=Em>isshar</span>, which is used before the name of a person who is deceased.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"xis","glotto_id":null,"glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Kisan","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":null,"progress":"Portions\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"IN","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"population":0,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"IN","name":"India","name_long":"The Republic of India","population":1339330514,"official_language":"Hindi","official_language_iso":"hin","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"IN","iso_a3":"IND","continent_id":"AS","iso_num":356,"religion_primary":"Hinduism","introduction":"The Indus Valley civilization one of the world's oldest flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science art and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century. ++ By the 19th century Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU eventually resulted in Indian independence which was granted in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The neighboring nations have fought three wars since independence the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008 terrorists originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai India's financial capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation environmental degradation extensive poverty and widespread corruption economic growth following the launch of economic reforms in 1991 and a massive youthful population are driving India's emergence as a regional and global power.","overview":"India is a vast South Asian country with diverse terrain – from Himalayan peaks to Indian Ocean coastline – and history reaching back 5 millennia.
