    "description": "The Haftarah is a series of selections from the books of Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) that is publicly read in synagogue as part of Jewish religious practice. The haftarah reading follows the Torah reading on each Sabbath and on Jewish festivals and fast days. Typically, the haftarah is thematically linked to the parashah (weekly Torah portion) that precedes it. The haftarah is sung in a chant (known as \"trope\" in Yiddish or \"Cantillation\" in English). Related blessings precede and follow the haftarah reading.",
