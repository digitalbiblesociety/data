    "description": "The Geneva Bible is a translation of scripture that arose alongside the Protestant Reformation in England. The brutal persecutions of Mary I pushed her kingdomâ€™s most prominent Bible scholars to Europe in a migration known as the Marian Exile. 800 English Bible translators including William Whittingham, Miles Coverdale, Christopher Goodman, Anthony Gilby, and John Knox fled to the European continent where they convened in Geneva, Switzerland, a city that had at that point become famous worldwide as a Mecca for persecuted Protestants, and, there, collaborated in the production of what would later be called The Geneva Bible which went on to inspire later translations like KJV and was the de facto Bible for Calvinist Christians.
