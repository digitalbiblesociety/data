Today, the language is generally written in either the Sundanese or the Latin script, but has historically also been written using other scripts. As of 1996, the Sundanese script has been the official script for the language; it is currently taught in schools and used for public signage.</p> <p>It is an abugida of Brahmic descent. The standardized script contains 23 consonants, each bearing an inherent vowel, and 7 independent vowels, as well as digits from 0-9. Dependent vowels are represented by means of diacritics above, below or alongside the consonant, altering the inherent vowel. The consonants ya, ra and la can also appear as diacritical marks when immediately following an initial consonant. </p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/7f/4e/7f4ec7h674_SundaVowels.png height=219 width=270 /></p> <p>Two additional characters were recently added to represent the sounds kha and sya, found in Arabic loan words. A virama character (shown above) exists for cancelling the inherent vowel; this is a separate character/akśra which follows the consonant, so unlike the virama characters of many other Brahmic abugidas it does not enable the formation of consonant clusters. Latin punctuation is used. There are two systems for ordering of the alphabet, both based on the Brahmic order by place of articulation.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"sun","glotto_id":"sund1252","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"su","name":"Sundanese","autonym":"ᮘᮞ ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Indonesia, Java and Bali","area":"Java, western third of the island.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"ID","latitude":"-6.897080","longitude":"107.106360","population":32400000,"status_id":"5","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"ID","name":"Indonesia","name_long":"The Republic of Indonesia","population":275122131,"official_language":"Indonesian","official_language_iso":"ind","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"ID","iso_a3":"IDN","continent_id":"AS","iso_num":360,"religion_primary":"Islam","introduction":"The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century; Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its independence shortly before Japan's surrender but it required four years of sometimes brutal fighting intermittent negotiations and UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty in 1949. A period of sometimes unruly parliamentary democracy ended in 1957 when President SOEKARNO declared martial law and instituted \\\"Guided Democracy.\\\" After an abortive coup in 1965 by alleged communist sympathizers SOEKARNO was gradually eased from power. From 1967 until 1988 President SUHARTO ruled Indonesia with his \\\"New Order\\\" government. After rioting toppled SUHARTO in 1998 free and fair legislative elections took place in 1999. Indonesia is now the world's third most populous democracy the world's largest archipelagic state and the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. Current issues include: alleviating poverty improving education preventing terrorism consolidating democracy after four decades of authoritarianism implementing economic and financial reforms stemming corruption reforming the criminal justice system holding the military and police accountable for human rights violations addressing climate change and controlling infectious diseases particularly those of global and regional importance. In 2005 Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement with armed separatists in Aceh which led to democratic elections in Aceh in December 2006. Indonesia continues to face low intensity armed resistance in Papua by the separatist Free Papua Movement.","overview":"'Indonesia a Southeast Asian nation made up of thousands of volcanic islands is home to hundreds of ethnic groups speaking many different languages.
