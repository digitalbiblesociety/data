    "description": "Punjabi is native language in the Punjab region, which is partly in Pakistan and partly in India. Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan. Western Punjabi in Pakistan is mainly written in Shahmukhī script, which is a modified form of the Persian Nastaʿlīq script. Eastern Punjabi in India is mainly written in Gurmukhi script in India. Punjabi can be written in a romanised form when it is called Roman Panjabi or Roman Punjabi. The whole of the Holy Injil or New Testament, was first published in Punjabi in 1912 which was revised in 1954. The British and Foreign Bible Society at Anarkali, Lahore produced the first 5 books of the New Testament into Roman Punjabi. Acts (Rasulan De AʼAmal) was published in 1917, then Matthew was published as Sáde Ḳhudáwand Yisúʼ Masíh dí Injíl jo Matí in 1920, and John was published as Sáde Ḳhudáwand Yisúʼ Masíh dí Injíl jo Yúhanná Rasúl dí Ráhíṉ Likhí Gaí in 1920, then Mark (Marqus) in 1923 and then Luke (Lúqá) in 1927. These 5 books in Roman Punjabi were digitised for the British and Foreign Bible Society in 2018. The 5 books were called Chauṉh Anajíl te Rusulan de AʼAmal 1927 (4 Gospels and Acts). ",
