{"abbr":"CYM1830","title":"Welsh Ruth, Psalms and Isaiah","title_vernacular":"Salmau 1-20 a detholiad o Ruth ac Eseia 1830-35 (Ioan Tegid)","description":"John Jones, the second son of Henry and Catherine Jones, was born in 1792 at Bala, in north Wales. He was christened at Llanycil church, on the banks of Llyn Tegid. It is from this lake which he later took his bardic name Ioan Tegid. He studied at Bala and at Carmarthen, before going to Jesus College, Oxford, which traditionally recruited students from Wales. In 1819 he was ordained into the Anglican Church and became chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford. He was a scholar of Welsh and Hebrew. Whilst at Oxford he transcribed the Mabinogi and other stories from the Red Book of Hergest for Lady Charlotte Guest. He returned to Wales in 1841 and took an active part in Eisteddfod gatherings. He was vicar of Nevern (Nanhyfer) in Pembrokeshire from 1842, and became canon of St Davidʼs Cathedral in 1848. He remained at Nevern until he died in 1852 aged 60. He was buried at Nevern, where there is a memorial to him. In 1859 his nephew published his poetry as Gwaith barddonawl y diweddar Barch. John Jones, M.A., Tegid. Tegid translated the book of Isaiah from Hebrew into English, which was published at Oxford in 1830, and went to a second edition in 1842. His English translation was made to help get feedback for his translation from Hebrew into Welsh. The full Welsh translation was never published, and the original manuscript has been lost. However he submitted selections from his translation of Isaiah to various Welsh language journals and they were published between 1830 and 1846. The surviving selections are Eseia 5:1-7; chapter 10; 14:5-19; 17:12-14; chapters 19 and 23; 45:11; chapter 53; and 58:13-14. Tegid also translated parts of Ruth and Psalms from Hebrew into Welsh. He published these in instalments in Y Gwyliedydd. Selections of Ruth were published in June and July 1833. The selections are Ruth 1:6; 2:5; 3:1, 4, 9-13, 15; and 4:4, 11, 13-14. Tegid followed this with his translation of the Psalms. These were published in monthly instalments between March 1834 and August 1835. He completed the first 20 psalms before giving up because he got no positive feedback. These selections of Scripture from Ruth, Psalms and Isaiah were digitised for the Bible Society in 2021, for the Welsh Scripture Digitisation Project. The collection has been called Salmau 1-20 a detholiad o Ruth ac Eseia 1830-35 (Ioan Tegid). ","description_vernacular":"Ganwyd John Jones, ail fab Henry a Catherine Jones, ym 1792 yn y Bala. Cafodd ei fedyddio yn eglwys Llanycil ar lan Llyn Tegid. Dyna darddiad ei enw barddol, Ioan Tegid, yn ddiweddarach. Astudiodd yn y Bala ac yng Nghaerfyrddin, cyn mynd ymlaen i Goleg Iesu, Rhydychen, oedd yn draddodiadol yn recriwtio myfyrwyr o Gymru. Ym 1819 cafodd ei ordeinio iʼr Eglwys Anglicanaidd, a daeth yn gaplan Christ Church, Rhydychen. Roedd yn ysgolhaig yn y Gymraeg aʼr Hebraeg. Tra yn Rhydychen trawsgrifiodd Y Mabinogi a straeon eraill o Lyfr Coch Hergest i Lady Charlotte Guest. Dychwelodd i Gymru ym 1841 a chymryd rhan weithredol mewn Eisteddfodau. Roedd yn ficer Nanhyfer yn Sir Benfro o 1842, a chafodd ei ddyrchafu yn Ganon Eglwys Gadeiriol Tyddewi ym 1848. Arhosodd yn Nanhyfer hyd nes iddo farw yn 60 oed ym 1852. Yno y cafodd ei gladdu, ac mae cofeb iddo yno hyd heddiw. Ym 1859 cyhoeddodd ei nai gasgliad oʼi farddoniaeth, Gwaith barddonawl y diweddar Barch. John Jones, M.A., Tegid. Cyfieithodd Tegid lyfr Eseia oʼr Hebraeg iʼr Saesneg. Feʼi cyhoeddwyd yn Rhydychen ym 1830, ac aeth i ail argraffiad ym 1842. Paratodd y cyfieithiad hwn gydaʼr bwriad o gael adborth ar gyfer ei gyfieithiad oʼr Hebraeg iʼr Gymraeg. Ni chafodd y cyfieithiad Cymraeg llawn erioed ei gyhoeddi ac maeʼr llawysgrif wreiddiol wedi ei cholli. Ond cyhoeddwyd detholiadau oʼi gyfieithiad o Eseia mewn amrywiol gyfnodolion Cymraeg rhwng 1830 a 1846. Yr adrannau sydd wedi goroesi yw Eseia 5:1-7; pennod 10; 14:4-19; 17:12-14; penodau 19 a 23; 45:11; pennod 53; a 58:13-14. Cyfieithodd Tegid rannau o Lyfr Ruth a Llyfr y Salmau iʼr Gymraeg hefyd. Cyhoeddodd y rhain yn Y Gwyliedydd. Cyhoeddwyd rhannau o Lyfr Ruth ym Mehefin a Gorffennaf 1833. Yr adnodau gyhoeddwyd oedd Ruth 1:6; 2:5; 3:1, 4, 9-13, 15; a 4:4, 11, 13-14. Dilynodd y detholiadau hyn gydaʼi gyfieithiadau oʼr Salmau. Cyhoeddwyd y rhain yn fisol rhwng Mawrth 1834 ac Awst 1835. Cwblhaodd yr ugain salm gyntaf cyn rhoiʼr gorau iddi am na chafodd unrhyw adborth cadarnhaol. Cafodd y detholiadau hyn o Lyfr Ruth, y Salmau ac Eseia eu digideiddio i Gymdeithas y Beibl yn 2021, ar gyfer Prosiect Digideiddio Ysgrythurau Cymraeg. Rhoddwyd y teitl Salmau 1-20 a detholiad o Ruth ac Eseia 1830-35 (Ioan Tegid) iʼr casgliad.","iso":"cym","script":"Latn","year":1830,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"Public Domain","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"CYM1830","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/3009-tegid-salmau-1-20-a-detholiad-o-ruth-ac-eseia-1830-35-ioan-tegid","title":"Salmau 1-20 a detholiad o Ruth ac Eseia 1830-35 (Ioan Tegid)","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"British \u0026amp; Foreign Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"CYM1830","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=302f4a2903a06e03","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":"S","type":"archive","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a"},{"bible_abbr":"CYM1830","url":"https://bible.com/versions/3009","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"CYM1830","organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a","equivalent_id":"302f4a2903a06e03","site":"","suffix":"","type":"DBL","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=302f4a2903a06e03"},{"bible_abbr":"CYM1830","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"3009","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/3009"}],"language":{"iso":"cym","glotto_id":"wels1247","iso1":"cy","name":"Welsh","autonym":"Cymraeg","level":"L","location":"Ireland and United Kingdom","area":"North, west, south Wales.

At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe.
