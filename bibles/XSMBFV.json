Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then. There have been increasing protests over the belief that the president may try to run for a currently unconstitutional third term in the 2015 presidential elections. Burkina Faso's high population growth and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens.","overview":"Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa. It covers an area of around 274200 square kilometres and is surrounded by six countries: Mali to the north; Niger to the east; Benin to the southeast.","independent":1,"landmass_km":273600,"population_christian":3746000,"population_christian_percentage":22,"population_catholic_percentage":18,"population_protestant_percentage":4,"population_refugee":25868,"population_migration":-25000,"population_year_change":2.86,"population_density_km":76,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":31,"population_literacy_percentage":36,"region_code":8,"region_id":202,"region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Burkina-Faso","url_national_society":"http://biblesociety-bf.org/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/bible-society-of-burkina-faso/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/burkina-faso/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/UV-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/BFA","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/burkina_faso.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Africa/Burkina_Faso","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/burkina-faso","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/burkina-faso/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/BF","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/burkina-faso.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/36423509","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Burkina%20Faso_dload_hi.mov"}}
