They are genetically highly heterogeneous. During the 1500s, they became virtually independent, although definitely not united. Unfortunately, their independence was short lived. Over the next 200 years, they became subjects of the Dzungarians, the Bukharans, and the Kazaks. The Dzungarians forced them to flee in two directions. One group, the upper Karakalpaks, went up the Syr Darya River to the Ferghana Basin. The second, the lower Karakalpaks, moved closer to the Aral Sea.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Cyrl","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"UZ","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://ibtrussia.org/en/text?m=KRK","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"IBTRussia","organization_id":"institute-for-bible-translation","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"epub","url":"http://ibtrussia.org/en/media?id=KRK/cyrl","title":"NTP","scope":null,"type":"epub","provider":"IBTRussia","organization_id":"institute-for-bible-translation","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"pdf","url":"http://ibtrussia.org/ftpmirror/pub/ebook/KRK/KRK/2-2009/Gen.pdf","title":"Genesis","scope":null,"type":"pdf","provider":"IBTRussia","organization_id":"institute-for-bible-translation","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/KAAIBT/MRK/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"app","url":"https://apk.fcbh.org/Karakalpak_IBT","title":"Global Bible App","scope":null,"type":"app","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/KAAIBT","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"audio_web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/KAAIBT","title":"NT","scope":null,"type":"audio_web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/1732-krknt-zhaa-kelisim","title":"Жаңа Келисим","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Institute for Bible Translation, Russia","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":"NT","bible_link_type":"archive","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=c3f4ba157ab847cd","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":null,"type":"archive","provider":"Digital Bible Library","organization_id":"digital-bible-library","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"audio","url":"https://www.bible.com/sr/audio-bible-app-versions/1732","title":"Karakalpak - 2004 Edition (NT)","scope":null,"type":"audio","provider":"Youversion","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":"NT","bible_link_type":"archiveaudio","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=b8d37cf0a02711e7","title":"Karakalpak - 2004 Edition (Drama - NT)","scope":null,"type":"archiveaudio","provider":"Digital Bible Library","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/KAAIBT_DBS_HS/Karakalpak-John-(print).pdf","title":"Karakalpak - John (Print)","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"","organization_id":"gospelgo","filesize":204879,"response_code":null}],"pod":[{"bible_id":"KAAIBT","publisher_id":"institute-for-bible-translation","partner_id":null,"description":"This Bible is copyrighted by Institute for Bible Translation, Moscow  (ibtrussia.org) and is provided with permission at the cost of printing by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org).

He and his brother are also credited with the invention of the Glagolitic script, a derivation of the Greek cursive alphabet which was modified to fit the sound systems of Slavic languages. Some historians credit Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyrils, with creating the Cyrillic script as a more readable writing system based on Glagolitic. The Cyrillic script was initially used for writing Old Church Slavonic (also called Old Bulgarian), but it has undergone a number of changes since that time, so much so that the old and modern variants are considered by many to be two different but related scripts. Many of the modern letterforms differ from those used in early Cyrillic writing, some letters have been dropped, and new letters have been added. An orthographic reform was implemented by the Russian tsar Peter the Great in 1708 which removed a number of obsolete letters so that Russian writing is now almost perfectly phonetic.</p> <p>The script has traditionally been used for writing the Slavic languages, of which Russian is the most widely spoken. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, particularly under Soviet rule, it was extended to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia.</p> <p>Cyrillic is written from left to right with spaces between words. Upper- and lowercase letters are used; most printed lowercase letters are simply smaller versions of their uppercase equivalents. However, the shapes of handwritten and italic letters can vary greatly from the shapes of printed letters. With the conversion of the script to non-Slavic languages in which new sounds needed to be written, a number of <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#multig target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;digraphs, trigraphs and tetragraphs</a> were employed. Russian and the Slavic languages use only a few digraphs. Many new letters were also created for writing the non-Slavic languages by adding hooks, breves or diaereses to existing letters. These marks are not considered diacritics, instead, a letter so modified is considered a separate letter with the mark an intrinsic part.</p> <p>After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the languages which had been forced to adopt the Cyrillic script opted instead to give the Latin or Arabic script official status. However, at the end of 2002, President Putin signed into law an addition to Russian Federation law stipulating that the alphabets of the state language of the Russian Federation and the state languages of its republics must be based on the Cyrillic script. Other scripts for the alphabets of the state language of the Russian Federation and the state languages of its republics can only be adopted under federal laws. The law was received very negatively in some states.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"kaa","glotto_id":"kara1467","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Kara-Kalpak","autonym":" قاراقالپاق تىلى","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan","area":"Along the lower Amu Darya; south Aral Sea area.

Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era intensive production of \\\"white gold\\\" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies which have left the land degraded and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991 upon the dissolution of the USSR the country has gradually lessened its dependence on the cotton monoculture by diversifying agricultural production while developing its mineral and petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base. Uzbekistan’s first president Islom KARIMOV led Uzbekistan for 25 years until his death in August 2016. The political transition to his successor then-Prime Minister Shavkat MIRZIYOYEV was peaceful but sidelined the constitutional process where the chairman of the Senate would have served as the acting president. MIRZIYOYEV who won the presidential election in December 2016 has sought to improve relations with Uzbekistan’s neighbors and proposed wide-ranging economic and judicial reforms.","overview":"'Uzbekistan is a Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic.
