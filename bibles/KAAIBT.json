{"abbr":"KAAIBT","title":"Karakalpak New Testament and Old Testament Portions","title_vernacular":"Карақалпақ тилиндеги Мухаддес Китап","description":"The Karakalpaks (\"Kara\" meaning black, and \"Kalpak\" meaning hat) live primarily in northwestern Uzbekistan with smaller populations in Turkey, Iran and other central Asian countries. The Karakalpaks emerged as a confederation of tribes at some time in the 15th or 16th centuries. They are genetically highly heterogeneous. During the 1500s, they became virtually independent, although definitely not united. Unfortunately, their independence was short lived. Over the next 200 years, they became subjects of the Dzungarians, the Bukharans, and the Kazaks. The Dzungarians forced them to flee in two directions. One group, the upper Karakalpaks, went up the Syr Darya River to the Ferghana Basin. The second, the lower Karakalpaks, moved closer to the Aral Sea.","iso":"kaa","script":"Cyrl","year":1996,"country_id":"UZ","copyright":"© Institute for Bible Translation, Moscow (Институт перевода Библии)","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"http://ibtrussia.org/en/text?m=KRK","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"IBTRussia","visible":true,"organization_id":"6c2a6a1a-3686-469f-93e9-d926d7fad9f1"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"http://ibtrussia.org/en/media?id=KRK/cyrl","title":"NTP","scope":"","type":"epub","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"IBTRussia","visible":true,"organization_id":"6c2a6a1a-3686-469f-93e9-d926d7fad9f1"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"http://ibtrussia.org/ftpmirror/pub/ebook/KRK/KRK/2-2009/Gen.pdf","title":"Genesis","scope":"","type":"pdf","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"IBTRussia","visible":true,"organization_id":"6c2a6a1a-3686-469f-93e9-d926d7fad9f1"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/KAAIBT/MRK/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://apk.fcbh.org/Karakalpak_IBT","title":"Global Bible App","scope":"","type":"app","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/KAAIBT","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/KAAIBT","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"audio_web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/1732-krknt-zhaa-kelisim","title":"Жаңа Келисим","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Institute for Bible Translation, Russia","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=c3f4ba157ab847cd","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":"NT","type":"archive","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://www.bible.com/sr/audio-bible-app-versions/1732","title":"Karakalpak - 2004 Edition (NT)","scope":"","type":"audio","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Youversion","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=b8d37cf0a02711e7","title":"Karakalpak - 2004 Edition (Drama - NT)","scope":"NT","type":"archiveaudio","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://archive.org/download/KAAIBT_DBS_HS/Karakalpak-John-(print).pdf","title":"Karakalpak - John (Print)","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"204879","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"e1c3d43c-728e-4f90-be74-af4ec38c554d"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://bible.com/versions/1732","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","url":"https://dbs.org/bibles/KAAIBT","title":"eBook Downloads","visible":true,"organization_id":"93619ca8-7f05-48dc-995c-6f46cdc94918"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a","equivalent_id":"c3f4ba157ab847cd","site":"","suffix":"","type":"DBL","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=c3f4ba157ab847cd"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"1732","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/1732"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","equivalent_id":"KAAIBTN","site":"bible.is","type":"api"},{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","equivalent_id":"53eb732a5117ad22d05a4b81","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"KAAIBT","publisher_id":"6c2a6a1a-3686-469f-93e9-d926d7fad9f1","description":"This Bible is copyrighted by Institute for Bible Translation, Moscow  (ibtrussia.org) and is provided with permission at the cost of printing by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org).

Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era intensive production of \\\"white gold\\\" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies which have left the land degraded and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991 upon the dissolution of the USSR the country has gradually lessened its dependence on the cotton monoculture by diversifying agricultural production while developing its mineral and petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base. Uzbekistan’s first president Islom KARIMOV led Uzbekistan for 25 years until his death in August 2016. The political transition to his successor then-Prime Minister Shavkat MIRZIYOYEV was peaceful but sidelined the constitutional process where the chairman of the Senate would have served as the acting president. MIRZIYOYEV who won the presidential election in December 2016 has sought to improve relations with Uzbekistan’s neighbors and proposed wide-ranging economic and judicial reforms.","overview":"'Uzbekistan is a Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic.
