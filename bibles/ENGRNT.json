    "description": "Henry Alford (7 October 1810 â€“ 12 January 1871) was an English churchman, theologian, textual critic, scholar, poet, hymnodist, and writer.<br><br>His chief fame rests on his monumental edition of the New Testament in Greek (8 vols.), which occupied him from 1841 to 1861. In this work he first produced a careful collation of the readings of the chief manuscripts and the researches of the ripest continental scholarship of his day. Philological rather than theological in character, it marked an epochal change from the old homiletic commentary, and though more recent research, patristic and papyral, has largely changed the method of New Testament exegesis, Alford's work is still a quarry where the student can dig with a good deal of profit. See Alford's Law for an example.<br><br>Alford subsequently published the New Testament for English Readers (4 vols., Rivingtons, 1868).",
