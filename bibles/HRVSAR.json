{"abbr":"HRVSAR","title":"Croatian Saric Translation","title_vernacular":"Sveto Pismo","description":"Ivan Šarić (27 September 1871 – 16 July 1960) was a Roman Catholic priest who became the archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vrhbosna (Sarajevo) in 1922. In 1940 Šarić was tasked by the national bishops' conference to put together the first modern Croatian translation of the Bible. A benefactor of the Bosnian Croat population, Šarić became a controversial figure because of his pro-Ustaše activities and rhetoric, including his support for forcible conversions to Catholicism inside the Independent State of Croatia during World War II.","iso":"hrv","script":"Latn","year":1942,"country_id":"HR","copyright":"© Croatian Bible Society","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","url":"https://www.biblesociety.org.uk/products/9789536709502/","title":"FBA","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"British and Foreign Bible Society","visible":false,"organization_id":"d3950ccc-dc18-4e63-92c2-a0f5e2eef6ac"},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","url":"http://www.beblia.com/pages/main.aspx?Language=Croatian\u0026Book=40\u0026Chapter=1","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Beblia","visible":false},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.solvus_lab.android.BibleHR_saric\u0026hl=en\u0026gl=US","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"app","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Google Play","visible":true,"organization_id":"0a8fa4d7-e5c4-4933-8f49-dc633669d168"},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","url":"https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/bible/croatian/","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"New Christian Bible Study","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/croatian-saric-new-testament","title":"Croatian (Saric) New Testament","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/croatian-saric-new-testament","title":"Croatian (Saric) New Testament","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","equivalent_id":"5461dba75117ad184271b222","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","equivalent_id":"547337535117ad3b5d564f3f","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","equivalent_id":"547337575117ad3ba9cdf40d","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","equivalent_id":"547337595117ad3ba9cdf40f","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"HRVSAR","publisher_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49","description":" ","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":1318,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":10,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"columns":2,"line_height":1.3,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T22:09:49-05:00","UpdatedAt":"2023-08-17T21:25:35-05:00"}],"language":{"iso":"hrv","glotto_id":"croa1245","iso1":"hr","name":"Croatian","autonym":"hrvatski","level":"L","area":"Also in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, United States.","country_id":"HR","latitude":45.200602,"longitude":16.826005,"population":5488390,"status_id":"1"},"country":{"id":"HR","name":"Croatia","name_long":"The Republic of Croatia","population":4208973,"official_language":"Croatian","official_language_iso":"hrv","iso_a3":"HRV","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":191,"language_count":24,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918 the Croats Serbs and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II Yugoslavia became a federal independent communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 it took four years of sporadic but often bitter fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands along with a majority of Croatia's ethnic Serb population. Under UN supervision the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998. The country joined NATO in April 2009 and the EU in July 2013.","overview":"'Croatia is an Eastern European country with a long coastline on the Adriatic Sea.
