It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"uzb","glotto_id":"uzb","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"uz","name":"Uzbek","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":null,"progress":null,"typology":null,"writing":null,"description":"See Northern (UZN) or Southern (UZS) Uzbek","country_id":"UZ","latitude":null,"longitude":null,"population":null,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"UZ","name":"Uzbekistan","name_long":"The Republic of Uzbekistan","population":30842796,"official_language":"Uzbek Northern","official_language_iso":"uzn","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"UZ","iso_a3":"UZB","continent_id":"AS","iso_num":860,"religion_primary":"Islam","introduction":"Russia conquered the territory of present-day Uzbekistan in the late 19th century. Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era intensive production of \\\"white gold\\\" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies which have left the land degraded and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991 upon the dissolution of the USSR the country has gradually lessened its dependence on the cotton monoculture by diversifying agricultural production while developing its mineral and petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base. Uzbekistan’s first president Islom KARIMOV led Uzbekistan for 25 years until his death in August 2016. The political transition to his successor then-Prime Minister Shavkat MIRZIYOYEV was peaceful but sidelined the constitutional process where the chairman of the Senate would have served as the acting president. MIRZIYOYEV who won the presidential election in December 2016 has sought to improve relations with Uzbekistan’s neighbors and proposed wide-ranging economic and judicial reforms.","overview":"'Uzbekistan is a Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic.
