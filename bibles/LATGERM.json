{"abbr":"LATGERM","title":"Psalter of Saint Germain","title_vernacular":"Psalterium Sancti Germani","description":"The manuscript presented here, Latin 11947 in the collections of the National Library of France, is known as the Psalter of Saint Germain of Paris. Saint Germain was born in France in circa 496. He became bishop of Paris in 555 and served in that position until his death in 576. The psalter contains the text of the Psalms from a version of the Old Latin Bible. The latter are translations of the Bible into Latin that predate the Vulgate, the authoritative translation made by Saint Jerome (died, 420) late in the fourth century. The manuscript is written in an uncial script, on crimson parchment, in silver ink. In the left margin are 70 letters R written in gold ink. Scholars have determined that the R stands for responsa (responsory), which indicate how the psalms were used in the liturgy. On the initial pages of the manuscript, the monks of Saint-Germain-des-Prés transcribed a text from Jerome’s preface to the book of Job, in which he stated that in ancient times purple parchment was used for luxury manuscripts.

In 1870 the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East sexual misconduct by clergy international development interreligious dialogue and reconciliation and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1.2 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith.","overview":"'Vatican City a city-state surrounded by Rome Italy is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church.
