{"abbr":"ENGTLV","title":"Tree of Life Bible","title_vernacular":"Tree of Life Bible","description":"Tree of Life Bible (TLV)\u003cbr\u003eA diverse community of Messianic Jewish and Christian scholars collaborated to produce The Tree of Life Messianic Family Bible-The New Covenant. Messianic rabbis, leaders, scholars, artists, professors, psalmists, linguists, writers, parents, and children came together to work on this groundbreaking version that is meant for the entire family to read and enjoy together. Wisdom is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, and happy are those who hold her fast (Proverbs 3:18). If you are a Jew who is curious about Messiah, this book will help you, with guidance from the Holy Spirit, to see how Yeshua became the Prophet, like Moses, full of glory, grace, and truth. Compare what the New Covenant says with what the Hebrew Bible says-the footnotes point the way for you. Many modern-day Christians recognize the value of rediscovering the Jewish roots of their faith, and Messianic Jews are growing in numbers and scholarship. The middle wall of partition is crumbling, and unity is being restored, teaching that diversity is strength.\u003cbr\u003eCopyright  © 2013, 2018 Messianic Jewish Family Bible.","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":2018,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"© Messianic Jewish Family Bible Society","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGTLV","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/314-tlv-tree-of-life-version","title":"Tree of Life Version","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Tree of Life Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGTLV","url":"https://bible.com/versions/314","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGTLV","url":"https://dbs.org/bibles/ENGTLV","title":"eBook Downloads","visible":true,"organization_id":"93619ca8-7f05-48dc-995c-6f46cdc94918"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGTLV","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"314","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/314"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGTLV","publisher_id":"5d9d2a38-c7a2-4a9e-874a-087ea95e269a","description":"","trim":"us_letter","scope":"bible","pages":933,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":10,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"columns":2,"line_height":1.2,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","UpdatedAt":"2023-10-20T20:19:11-05:00"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGTLV","publisher_id":"5d9d2a38-c7a2-4a9e-874a-087ea95e269a","description":"","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":1695,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"CrimsonPro-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"CrimsonPro-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":9,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"columns":2,"line_height":1,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-09T20:47:42-06:00","UpdatedAt":"2023-08-17T19:37:19-05:00"}],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000},"country":{"id":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","name_long":"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","population":67081000,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"GBR","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":826,"language_count":101,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe.
