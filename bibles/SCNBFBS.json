These were followed by the Gospel of Matthew (Lu Santu Vancelu di Gesù Cristu Secunnu Matteu; italiano: Il Vangelo di S. Matteo) published in London 1861. They were translated into Sicilian by Luigi Scalia (volgarizzato in dialetto siciliano dall' Luigi Scalia).\n\nThe translations were commissioned by Prince Louis Luciano Bonaparte. He was a great linguist who commissioned translations into lesser languages and dialects of Europe. The Gospel of Matthew was also published with his linguistic comparative observations on the nature of Sicilian (Osservazioni linguistico-camparative sulla natura del siciliano). These portions were published in 1860 and 1861, with 250 copies, by Strangeways and Walden, of 28 Castle Street, Leicester Square, London. \n\nDigital Edition: These books were digitised for the Bible Society with the help of MissionAssist in 2021.
