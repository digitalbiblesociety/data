Singapore. It is used for writing the varieties of the Chinese language spoken in these place. There is some debate as to whether varieties of Chinese (many of which are mutually unintelligible) should be classified as separate languages or dialects of a single language. Speakers of Chinese tend to perceive them as dialects, but some linguists consider this identification to be inappropriate. Given the high level of internal variation in the spoken language, it is the written form which has provided a means for unifying Chinese culture, as the same characters are used for representing the same concepts across dialects/languages. There are two styles of Chinese characters; traditional and simplified. The traditional form has been used since the 5th century AD, and the simplified form is generally associated with the formation of the PRC in 1949, who introduced the script in an effort to increase literacy, although some non-standard simplified forms existed long before this time.</p> <p>The simplified forms of characters were created by modifying the traditional forms so that complex components of some characters were omitted entirely or replaced by a simpler component. Some traditional characters were replaced in print by their cursive equivalents, which tend to be visually simpler. Occasionally, less complex ancient forms of a character were adopted in place of the standard traditional form. Many simplified characters do not bear any immediate resemblance to their traditional equivalents unless the reader knows what modifications were applied. Some traditional forms were not modified at all so are the same in both scripts.</p> <p>There is a problem of underdifferentiation in Simplified Han writing; reducing the number of strokes makes characters easier to write, but also reduces their distinctness for the reader by the same measure. Some words which were previously represented by distinct characters are now all represented by a single character and it must be determined from the context which interpretation is intended.</p> <p>The exact number of Simplified Han characters varies from source to source, in part because the number is always growing as new words are added to the lexicon. A competent grasp of approximately 2,500 characters is considered by educators to be essential for basic reading and writing skills, and about 5,200 characters are estimated to account for over 99% of the characters in use. The <span class=Em>Xīnhuá zìdiăn</span> (New China Character Dictionary) lists 8,075 characters. The canonical order of signs arranges them according to semantic classifications ranging from specific to general; signs related to mankind, minerals, height etc.</p> <p>Simplified Han can be written vertically or horizontally, but modern texts are almost always written in horizontal lines from left-to-right. In some cases, particularly where Simplified Han is used alongside a right-to-left script, for example in a bilingual Chinese-Arabic dictionary, the Han characters may also be written from right to left. Vertical text alignment is often used on signposts which are longer than they are wide, as well as for aesthetic purposes, and is always used in calligraphic texts.</p> <p>The adoption of Simplified Han characters has been controversial; supporters praise the script for its simplicity and claim that it is easier to learn, although there is no empirical evidence to suggest that the increase in Chinas literacy rate has been due to the simplified script as opposed to financial investment in education. Critics claim that there was a propaganda motive in disseminating the simpler characters; the Chinese Communist Cultural Revolution perceived anything \\\\\\old\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"traditional\\\\\\\" to be hampering progression"},"children":[{"id":"CMNNPSETS","parent_bible_id":"CMNUNVS","gbc":null,"date":"1996","iso":"cmn","title":"Traditional Chinese Union Shen Edition","title_vernacular":"神版","copyright":"© Hong Kong Bible Society","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hant","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"CN","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CMNNPSS","parent_bible_id":"CMNUNVS","gbc":null,"date":"1996","iso":"cmn","title":"Simplified Chinese Union Shangti Edition","title_vernacular":"上帝版","copyright":"© Hong Kong Bible Society","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"CN","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CMNUNNP","parent_bible_id":"CMNUNVS","gbc":null,"date":"1988","iso":"cmn","title":"New Punctuation Chinese Union Version ","title_vernacular":"新标点和合本","copyright":"© China Christian Council","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"聯合聖經公會出版了《新標點和合本》。该版所做的修订主要包括：使用通用标点符号，按诗体排印原文为诗的经文，按现代用法区别使用第三人称代词，将现在通用的字代替某些不再使用的字，如把「喫」、「纔」、「彀」改為「吃」、「才」、「夠」，又修改部份人名譯法，有的地名採現代譯名。该版本主要在海外华人信徒中推行，也有人对人地名的改动提出了反对意见，例如望文生義地指「流便」是「不雅的譯名」，改成「呂便」，而不知「流便」這譯名其實也是形容詞，實際意思是“暢順”，與修訂者所想的截然不同。","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"CN","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CMNUNVHW","parent_bible_id":"CMNUNVS","gbc":null,"date":"1907","iso":"cmn","title":"Chinese Union High Wenli Version","title_vernacular":"文理和合譯本《新舊約全書》","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"Digital edition of the Chinese Union High WenliVersion (1919). Created by Simon Wong.

Sheffield，1841-1913）接替。  翻譯人員參考了當時幾個重要的譯本，包括《委辦譯本》（《新約》1852年；《舊約》1854年）、裨治文和克陛存所譯版本（1863年）以及高德譯的《新約》。事實上，新約部分的翻譯工作，主要是以《委辦譯本》為基礎加以修訂。 《深文理和合譯本》的「新約」部分於1906年完成，並於次年（1907年）出版，恰逢第三屆「在華新教傳教士大會」。在大會上，傳教士們一致決定把深、淺文理翻譯項目合而為一，作為深文理。隨後，文理舊約委員會成立。除了原來的委員會成員謝衛樓（主席）、羅為霖和惠志道外，還有禮賢會（Rhenish Missionary Society）的葉道勝（Gottlieb I. Genähr，1856-1937）和英國長老會（English Presbyterian Mission）的安飽德（Patrick J. Maclagan，1865-1958）。《深文理和合譯本》於1919年初版，該譯本結合了1907年的深文理《新約》和後來譯成的《舊約》。 當時適逢白話文運動，社會提出廢除舊文學（文言文）、提倡新文學（國語），《官話和合譯本》（1919年）迅速成為國內的標準《聖經》譯本。然而，今天有許多讀者和中文《聖經》翻譯歷史方面的學者，仍然對文理《聖經》（如《深文理和合譯本》）的出版抱有極大的興趣。因此，以全數字化的形式把這些資源呈現出來，供大眾閱讀和使用，具有極大的《聖經》倡導價值。","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hant","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0}],"language":{"iso":"cmn","glotto_id":"mand1415","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Mandarin Chinese","autonym":"官话; 官話; Guānhuà","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"China","area":"Widespread north of Changjiang River, a belt south of the Changjiang from Qiujiang (Jiangxi) to Zhenjiang (Jiangsu), Hubei, except southeast corner, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, northwest part of Guangxi, and northwest corner of Hunan.
