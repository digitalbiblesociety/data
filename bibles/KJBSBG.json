{"abbr":"KJBSBG","title":"Q'anjob'al 1989 Edition","title_vernacular":"A Txꞌan Biblia Yin Kꞌanjobal 1989","description":"The Q’anjob’al Bible was translated by Newberry and Kittie Cox. They helped establish and run a school, the Huehue Academy. In addition to publishing “The Bible Translator” their book detailing the Bible Translation Experience. They detail in their book a difficulty that arose from the translation of the phrase “The Kingdom of God.” The kingdom of God may be translated as where God supervises (or literally guards). However, in Mark 10:15 and Luke 18:17 it is not possible to speak of receiving the kingdom of God, for this would imply that one simply takes over the responsibility for guarding God’s country while He rests. Accordingly, the translation is adapted to meet the cultural and linguistic requirements of the language by the form receive God as king.","iso":"kjb","script":"Latn","year":1989,"country_id":"GT","copyright":"© Sociedad Bíblica de Guatemala

After almost three centuries as a Spanish colony Guatemala won its independence in 1821. During the second half of the 20th century it experienced a variety of military and civilian governments as well as a 36-year guerrilla war. In 1996 the government signed a peace agreement formally ending the internal conflict which had left more than 200000 people dead and had created by some estimates about 1 million refugees.","overview":"Guatemala a Central American country south of Mexico is home to volcanoes rainforests and ancient Mayan sites. The capital Guatemala City features the stately National Palace of Culture and the National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Antigua west of the capital contains preserved Spanish colonial buildings.
