    "description": "In 1545, Miles Coverdale compiled the works of John Wycliffe and other Bible translators into a complete translation of the Old and New Testaments, the first in English. Though the first were published under questionable legality, the 1537 edition was printed with the Royal Seal of Edward VI. The Coverdale Bible was a significant step forward in the development of the English Bible and went on to influence every English Bible translation that came after it.",
