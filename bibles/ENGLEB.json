    "description": "The Lexham English Bible (LEB) New Testament was published and released by Logos Bible Software in October 2010. It lists as General Editor W. Hall Harris, III. The Old Testament translation was completed in 2011. At its release, it only included the New Testament and was simultaneously offered for free use for Logos users as well as other popular software suites, including freeware such as e-Sword and The SWORD Project. These have since been updated to include the Old Testament. It can also be accessed in its entirety on websites listed below. The LEB is available under a very permissive license which allows royalty-free commercial and non-commercial use. <br>Copyright 2010 Logos Bible Software.
