{"abbr":"ENGNASB","title":"New American Standard Bible","description":"While preserving the literal accuracy of the 1901 ASV, the NASB has sought to render grammar and terminology in contemporary English. Special attention has been given to the rendering of verb tenses to give the English reader a rendering as close as possible to the sense of the original Greek and Hebrew texts. In 1995, the text of the NASB was updated for greater understanding and smoother reading. \u003cbr\u003eCopyright  © 1960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1995 by The Lockman Foundation.\u003cbr\u003eSince its completion in 1971, the New American Standard Bible has been widely embraced as a literal and accurate English translation because it consistently uses the formal equivalence translation philosophy. This method translates word-for-word from the original languages as much as possible. At the same time it recognizes the need for the translation to be readable.\u003cbr\u003eMillions of people have trusted the NASB for connecting with God while reading, learning, and applying the Bible’s teaching and wisdom to the demands of daily life. The accuracy of the NASB makes it a trusted choice of many students, scholars, pastors, and missionaries as they study and teach the Word of God. Read the NASB for yourself and discover the original meaning of the biblical texts.","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":1960,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"© The Lockman Foundation","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/eng-NASB","title":"BibleSearch","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"American Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"0c51d6dd-1184-4288-8ead-6b34349693a4"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-bible/nasb/genesis/1/","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Biblica","visible":true,"organization_id":"d96b0cc5-a527-4a2d-8dbe-80ee0d946a77"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/ENGNAS/GEN/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":false,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo\u0026vid=49\u0026lang=53","title":"New American Standard Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible Gateway","visible":true,"organization_id":"9696ef31-b54c-4a20-82ab-f1b8a527e48a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ENGNAS","title":"Full Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":false,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/100-nasb1995-new-american-standard-bible-nasb-1995","title":"New American Standard Bible - NASB 1995","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"The Lockman Foundation","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/nasb-megavoice-envoy-digital-audio-bible","title":"NASB MegaVoice Envoy Digital Audio Bible","scope":"","type":"audio","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/nasb-megavoice-envoy-digital-audio-bible","title":"NASB MegaVoice Envoy Digital Audio Bible","scope":"","type":"audio","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=b8ee27bcd1cae43a","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":"FB","type":"archive","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","url":"https://bible.com/versions/100","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a","equivalent_id":"b8ee27bcd1cae43a","site":"","suffix":"","type":"DBL","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=b8ee27bcd1cae43a"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"100","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/100"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","equivalent_id":"ENGNASN2ET","site":"bible.is","type":"api"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","equivalent_id":"ENGNASO","site":"bible.is","type":"api"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","equivalent_id":"ENGNASO2ET","site":"bible.is","type":"api"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGNASB","publisher_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49","description":" ","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":2420,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":10,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"columns":2,"line_height":1.3,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T22:09:48-05:00","UpdatedAt":"2023-08-17T19:12:31-05:00"}],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000},"country":{"id":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","name_long":"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","population":67081000,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"GBR","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":826,"language_count":101,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe. England – birthplace of Shakespeare and The Beatles – is home to the capital London a globally influential centre of finance and culture.
