Special attention has been given to the rendering of verb tenses to give the English reader a rendering as close as possible to the sense of the original Greek and Hebrew texts. In 1995, the text of the NASB was updated for greater understanding and smoother reading. <br>Copyright  © 1960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1995 by The Lockman Foundation.<br>Since its completion in 1971, the New American Standard Bible has been widely embraced as a literal and accurate English translation because it consistently uses the formal equivalence translation philosophy. This method translates word-for-word from the original languages as much as possible. At the same time it recognizes the need for the translation to be readable.<br>Millions of people have trusted the NASB for connecting with God while reading, learning, and applying the Bible’s teaching and wisdom to the demands of daily life. The accuracy of the NASB makes it a trusted choice of many students, scholars, pastors, and missionaries as they study and teach the Word of God. Read the NASB for yourself and discover the original meaning of the biblical texts.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":2,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://bibles.org/versions/eng-NASB","title":"BibleSearch","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"American Bible Society","organization_id":"american-bible-society","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/online-bible/nasb/genesis/1/","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Biblica","organization_id":"biblica","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/ENGNAS/GEN/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=49&lang=53","title":"New American Standard Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Bible Gateway","organization_id":"bible-gateway","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ENGNAS","title":"Full Bible","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/100-nasb1995-new-american-standard-bible-nasb-1995","title":"New American Standard Bible - NASB 1995","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"The Lockman Foundation","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"audio","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/nasb-megavoice-envoy-digital-audio-bible","title":"NASB MegaVoice Envoy Digital Audio Bible","scope":null,"type":"audio","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","organization_id":"bible-society-of-canada","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"audio","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/nasb-megavoice-envoy-digital-audio-bible","title":"NASB MegaVoice Envoy Digital Audio Bible","scope":null,"type":"audio","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","organization_id":"bible-society-of-canada","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB","bible_size_id":"FB","bible_link_type":"archive","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=b8ee27bcd1cae43a","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":null,"type":"archive","provider":"Digital Bible Library","organization_id":"digital-bible-library","filesize":null,"response_code":null}],"pod":[],"alphabet":{"script":"Latn","name":"Latin","unicode_pdf":null,"family":"European","type":"alphabet","white_space":"between words","open_type_tag":"latn","complex_positioning":"yes","requires_font":false,"unicode":true,"diacritics":true,"contextual_forms":false,"reordering":false,"case":null,"split_graphs":false,"status":"Current","baseline":"bottom","ligatures":"optional","direction":"ltr","direction_notes":null,"sample":null,"sample_img":null,"description":"<p>The Latin script (also called the Roman script) is the most widely used writing system in the world, being the script of the English language, spoken by over 300,000,000 people worldwide. It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[{"id":"ENGNASB20","parent_bible_id":"ENGNASB","gbc":null,"date":"2020","iso":"eng","title":"New American Standard Bible (NASB)","title_vernacular":"New American Standard Bible 2020","copyright":"© 1960 - 2020 by The Lockman Foundation","guid":null,"description":"The NASB 2020 is an update of the NASB 1995 that further improves accuracy where possible, modernizes language, and improves readability.
