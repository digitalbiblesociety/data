    "description": "While preserving the literal accuracy of the 1901 ASV, the NASB has sought to render grammar and terminology in contemporary English. Special attention has been given to the rendering of verb tenses to give the English reader a rendering as close as possible to the sense of the original Greek and Hebrew texts. In 1995, the text of the NASB was updated for greater understanding and smoother reading. <br>Copyright  © 1960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1995 by The Lockman Foundation.<br>Since its completion in 1971, the New American Standard Bible has been widely embraced as a literal and accurate English translation because it consistently uses the formal equivalence translation philosophy. This method translates word-for-word from the original languages as much as possible. At the same time it recognizes the need for the translation to be readable.<br>Millions of people have trusted the NASB for connecting with God while reading, learning, and applying the Bible’s teaching and wisdom to the demands of daily life. The accuracy of the NASB makes it a trusted choice of many students, scholars, pastors, and missionaries as they study and teach the Word of God. Read the NASB for yourself and discover the original meaning of the biblical texts.",
