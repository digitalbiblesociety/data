After being joined by two other Baptist missionaries in 1799 he moved to the Danish colony of Serampore, where missionaries were looked upon more kindly than in those parts of India where the East India Company held sway. Carey and his companions established a printing press there and baptised their first Hindu convert to Christianity, Krishna Pal, in the following year.<br>In 1800 Carey produced a translation of the Gospel of Matthew into Bengali in an edition of 500 copies. By the following year he had completed the translation of the entire New Testament into that language and it was printed in an edition of 2,000 copies.<br>The translation of the Old Testament followed in 1809. Carey was a prolific translator and an able linguist; by the time of his death he had translated the Bible or portions of it into 34 different Asian languages and dialects, including Chinese, Hindi and Gujarati, and 200,000 individual copies of Biblical works had rolled off the presses of the Serampore Mission Press.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Beng","versification":"Bengali","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"IN","copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-1054-7","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/1791-rovu-","title":"পবিত্র বাইবেল (কেরী ভার্সন)","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Bangladesh Bible Society","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/bengali-bible","title":"Bengali Bible","scope":null,"type":"print","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","organization_id":"bible-society-of-canada","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/bengali-bible","title":"Bengali Bible","scope":null,"type":"print","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","organization_id":"bible-society-of-canada","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":"FB","bible_link_type":"archive","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=e4a6c48f010eec59","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":null,"type":"archive","provider":"Digital Bible Library","organization_id":"digital-bible-library","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"https://virtualstorehouse.org/collections/all-available-bibles/products/bengali-ben","title":"","scope":"FB\r","type":"print","provider":"Virtual Storehouse","organization_id":"virtual-storehouse","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"genesis","url":"http://downloads.dbs.org/archive/Bengali-(1973)-Genesis-Portion.pdf","title":"Bengali (1973) Genesis Portion","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bangladesh Bible Society","organization_id":"bible-society-of-bangladesh","filesize":488299,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/BENWYC_DBS_HS/Bengali-English-(1819)-Gospels-(Diglot).pdf","title":"Bengali-English (1819) Gospels (Diglot)","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Archive","organization_id":"archive-bible","filesize":25699110,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"BENWYC","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/BENWYC_DBS_HS/Bangla-John-(book).pdf","title":"Bangla -

It is also used for a number of other Indian languages including Sylheti and, with one or two modifications, Assamese. It is a Brahmic script although its exact derivation is disputed. Bengali writing shares some similarities with the Dravidian-language scripts, particularly in the shapes of some vowel letters, but it is generally more similar to the Aryan-language scripts, in particular Devanagari.</p> <p>Bengali is an abugida - that is, every consonant letter represents a syllable containing an inherent vowel - written from left to right. There is no upper- or lower-case. There are thirty-five consonant letters and eleven independent vowel letters, two of which represent the diphthongs oj and ow. Each vowel letter also has a diacritic form which combines with a consonant to modify the inherent vowel. These can be written to the left or the right of, or above or below the consonant. Some are <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#multig target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;digraphs</a>, written with part of the letter before and part after the consonant. Some vowel diacritics take contextual forms, for example <span class=Em>u</span> changes shape following <span class=Em>g</span> or <span class=Em>ʃ</span>. Some consonant-vowel combinations have a traditional ligated form which is often visually dissimilar to the base consonant+vowel diacritic form. These are more commonly found in handwriting, but occasionally in printed text also.</p> <p>There are three modifier signs, <span class=Em>khanda-ta</span> (represents a final dental stop), <span class=Em>anusvara</span> (nasalizes a final velar), <span class=Em>visarga</span> (represents a voiceless breath after a vowel), and <span class=Em>chandra bindu</span> (nasalizes a vowel). There is also a symbol, <span class=Em>hasanta</span>, to mute the inherent vowel.</p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/j6/sp/j6spskdfbr_BengaliSigns.png height=192 width=249 /></p> <p>Bengali writing differs from most Indian abugidas in that the inherent vowel in a syllable is either ɔ or o. In general, it is pronounced ɔ except when followed by i, j, u or w, in which contexts it is pronounted o. However this is not always predictable. In addition, at the end of a syllable (at the end of or within a word), the vowel is often not pronounced even when this is not indicated with <span class=Em>hasanta</span>. So the letters <span class=Em>m</span>+<span class=Em>t</span> can represent either mɔt opinion or moto approximately, but <span class=Em>g</span>+<span class=Em>t</span> always represents gɔto past.</p> <p>Consonants regularly form conjuncts, normally of two letters, more rarely of three or four. Often these involve little or no change in letterform, but in some cases one letter changes unrecognizably from its isolated form and in a few cases both letters do so. Conjuncts are written with the parts alongside each other or in stacks. Pronunciation of conjuncts is not always what would be expected from the sum of their parts, due to sound changes in spoken Bengali which are not represented in writing. The <span class=Em>j</span>+<span class=Em>ñ</span> conjunct is pronounced g+nasalization at the start of a word or gg elsewhere, for example <span class=Em>bijña</span>, pronounced biggo/õ wise. Combinations of C+<span class=Em>m</span> are pronounced at the start of a word as C+nasalization, or as CC elsewhere. The conjunct <span class=Em>kʃa</span> represents khɔ at the start of a word and khhɔ within a word, as in the case of the womans name written <span class=Em>lakʃmi</span> but pronounced lokkhi.</p> <p><img src=http://scriptsource.org/cms/scripts/../sites/s/media/database/ssproto/entries/j6/sp/j6spskdfbr_BengaliConjuncts.png height=170 width=360 /></p> <p>Some other spelling conventions also reflect archaic pronunciation. The three sibilant letters which represented three separate sounds ʂ, ʃ and s in Brahmi writing have been retained in Bengali orthography, all representing ʃ except before t, n, r or l, when they all assimilate to s. </p> <p>Bengali employs a set of script-specific digits 0-9.</p> <p>The Devanagari full stop, a vertical line, is used in Bengali alongside Latin punctuation. </p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"ben","glotto_id":"beng1280","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"bn","name":"Bengali","autonym":"বাংলা","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Bangladesh","area":"West.

Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science art and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century. ++ By the 19th century Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU eventually resulted in Indian independence which was granted in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The neighboring nations have fought three wars since independence the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008 terrorists originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai India's financial capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation environmental degradation extensive poverty and widespread corruption economic growth following the launch of economic reforms in 1991 and a massive youthful population are driving India's emergence as a regional and global power.","overview":"India is a vast South Asian country with diverse terrain – from Himalayan peaks to Indian Ocean coastline – and history reaching back 5 millennia.
