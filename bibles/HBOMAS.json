    "description": "The Masoretic Text (MT or 𝕸; Hebrew: נוסח המסורה‎, romanized: Nusakh haMasora) is the authoritative Hebrew and Aramaic text of the 24 books of the Tanakh in Rabbinic Judaism. The Masoretic Text defines the Jewish canon and its precise letter-text, with its vocalization and accentuation known as the masorah. It was primarily copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era (CE). The oldest extant manuscripts date from around the 9th century. The Aleppo Codex (once the oldest-known complete copy but missing large sections since the 1947 Civil war in Palestine) dates from the 10th century.",
