{"abbr":"GLA1891","title":"Scottish Gaelic Psalms","title_vernacular":"Frae Hebrew intil Scottis","description":"Gaelic psalm singing, or Gaelic psalmody, is a tradition of exclusive psalmody in the Scottish Gaelic language found in Presbyterian churches in the Western Isles of Scotland. It is a form of Gaelic music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe psalms are sung unaccompanied, in a style known as \"lining out\" or \"precenting the line,\" in which the leader of the performance, or \"precentor,\" sings a line, after which the rest of the congregation follows, with each member allowed to embellish the melody as they wish, in a free heterophonic fashion. The style of Gaelic psalm singing is influenced by piobaireachd music native to the Scottish Highlands, with frequent and distinctive use of ornamentation and grace notes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce common all over the Protestant, Gaelic-speaking regions of Scotland, Gaelic psalm singing has declined to a few Gaelic-speaking churches in the Scottish Hebrides, primarily on the Isle of Lewis but also the Isle of Harris, North Uist, Benbecula, and Skye. In the 20th century, it could also be found in regions of lowland Scotland that saw large amounts of Highland immigration, such as Partick in Glasgow, though this has largely ceased.","iso":"gla","script":"Latn","year":1891,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"Public Domain","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"GLA1891","url":"https://archive.org/download/GLA1891_DBS_HS/Scottish-Gaelic-(1891)-Psalms-(Frae-Hebrew-intil-Scottis).pdf","title":"Scottish Gaelic (1891) Psalms","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"10916026","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"}],"language":{"iso":"gla","glotto_id":"scot1245","iso1":"gd","name":"Scottish Gaelic","autonym":"Gàidhlig","level":"L","location":"Ireland and United Kingdom","area":"North and central counties of Ross, islands of Hebrides and Skye, Glasgow.

At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe.
