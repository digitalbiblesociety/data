    "description": "Rev. Thomas Thomson (T. T.) Alexander was born in 1881 at Penicuik, Midlothian in Scotland. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1903. In 1907 he married Margaret Marwick in Edinburgh. He was ordained in Canada and served in Blackburn and then from 1911 in Orkney. In 1914 he went as a Church of Scotland missionary to Livingstonia, Zambia but returned to Scotland in 1915 when he fell ill. From 1922 to 1932 Rev T.T. Alexander served as minister at St Ninian’s Church, Leith. Rev T. T. Alexander died childless in Wantage, Oxfordshire in England on 14 June 1945. When Rev T.T. Alexander served as minister at St Ninian’s Church, Leith he introduced services in Braid Scots. He translated 20 of the Psalms (Psalms 1, 8, 19, 40, 43, 46, 50, 65, 64, 90, 93, 100, 103, 121, 122, 124, 124, 126, 130 and 137) into metrical form in Scots, to be sung to well-known tunes. These were published as the “Metrical Psalms in Braid Scots”, by W. Chadwick in Edinburgh in 1928.",
