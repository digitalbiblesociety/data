{"abbr":"ENGWYC","title":"Wycliffe's Bible","description":"Wycliffe's Bible is the name now given to a group of Bible translations into Middle English that were made under the direction of John Wycliffe. They appeared over a period from approximately 1382 to 1395.  There are 250 Wycliffe Bibles that survive today in various degrees of completeness. It is estimated that about twenty-one contain or might have had the complete Wycliffe Bible, also known as the English Wycliffite Bible or the Lollard Bible. There are 89 Wycliffe Bibles that contain just the New Testament. There are fifteen Wycliffe Bibles that have just the four Gospels of the New Testament. There are four copies of the Wycliffe Bible that comprise only the letters from the Apostles to the Christians commonly called the Epistles.","iso":"enm","script":"Latn","year":1360,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"Public Domain","copyright_type":"OPEN","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGWYC","url":"https://archive.org/download/ENGWYC_DBS_HS/English-(1731)-Wycliffe-New-Testament-(John-Lewis-Edition).pdf","title":"English (1731) Wycliffe New Testament (John Lewis Edition)","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"48946546","response_code":"0","provider":"Wycliffe","visible":true,"organization_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWYC","url":"https://archive.org/download/ENGWYC_DBS_HS/English-(1848)-Wycliffe-New-Testament-(Pickering-Version)-facsimilie.pdf","title":"English (1848) Wycliffe New Testament (Pickering Version) facsimilie","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"127636955","response_code":"0","provider":"Wycliffe \u0026 Pickering","visible":true,"organization_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWYC","url":"https://archive.org/download/ENGWYC_DBS_HS/English-(1879)-Wycliffe-(Purvey)-New-Testament.pdf","title":"English (1879) Wycliffe (Purvey) New Testament","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"13967250","response_code":"0","provider":"Wycliffe and Purvey","visible":true,"organization_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGWYC","url":"https://archive.org/download/ENGWYC_DBS_HS/English-(1425)-Wycliffe-New-Testament.pdf","title":"English (1425) Wycliffe New Testament","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"11077079","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGWYC","publisher_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49","description":" ","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":1930,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":10,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"columns":2,"line_height":1.3,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T22:09:48-05:00","UpdatedAt":"2023-08-17T20:14:22-05:00"}],"language":{"iso":"enm","glotto_id":"midd1317","name":"Middle English (1100-1500)","level":"H","country_id":"GB","status_id":"9"},"country":{"id":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","name_long":"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","population":67081000,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"GBR","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":826,"language_count":101,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe.
