    "description": "Worrell was brought up as a Landmark Baptist, but later in life converted to Pentecostalism. His translation reflects both traditions.<br><br>A. S. Worrell sought to update the accuracy and grammar of the King James Version in his translation of the New Testament and included his personal study notes in it as well.<br><br>Worrell introduced the work as follows:<br><br>This translation is the outgrowth of a solemn conviction that such a work was required of the writer by Him Whose he is, and Whom he seeks to serve. The translator, A. S. Worrell, spent two and one-half years devoted to the work. It was done with the view of pleasing the Supreme Critic, at Whose judgment bar he will have to account for the manner in which he has handled His word.<br><br>The work was begun and prosecuted under the distinct conviction that these New Testament Scriptures are the veritable word of God â€“ His last revelation to this sin-cursed world. The translator believed that these Scriptures contain nothing but \"live matter\"; and that they are as true now and as applicable to man's needs as a tripartite being as they ever were.",
