These differences complicated the establishment of a working political community after independence was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100000 lives. The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986 has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. A constitutional referendum in 2005 cancelled a 19-year ban on multi-party politics and lifted presidential term limits.","overview":"Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa whose diverse landscape encompasses the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains and immense Lake Victoria. Its abundant wildlife includes chimpanzees as well as rare birds. Remote Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is a renowned mountain gorilla sanctuary. Murchison Falls National Park in the northwest is known for its 43m-tall waterfall and wildlife such as hippos.","independent":1,"landmass_km":199810,"population_christian":29943000,"population_christian_percentage":88.6,"population_catholic_percentage":41.9,"population_protestant_percentage":46.7,"population_refugee":1359464,"population_migration":168694,"population_year_change":3.32,"population_density_km":229,"population_average_age":17,"population_urban_percentage":26,"population_literacy_percentage":73,"region_code":7,"region_id":202,"region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Uganda","url_national_society":"http://www.biblesociety-uganda.org/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/bible-society-of-uganda/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/uganda/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/UG-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/UKR","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/uganda.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Africa/Uganda","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/uganda","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/uganda/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/UG","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/uganda.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/23007848","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Uganda2_dload_hi.mp4"}}
