It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"twl","glotto_id":"tawa1270","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Tawara","autonym":"chiShona","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Mozambique","area":"South of Tete Province, north of Zimbabwe.","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"MZ","latitude":"-16.016740","longitude":"31.620990","population":110000,"status_id":"6a","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"MZ","name":"Mozambique","name_long":"The Republic of Mozambique","population":30888034,"official_language":"Portuguese","official_language_iso":"por","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"MZ","iso_a3":"MOZ","continent_id":"AF","iso_num":508,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration economic dependence on South Africa a severe drought and a prolonged civil war hindered the country's development until the mid-1990s. The ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party formally abandoned Marxism in 1989 and a new constitution the following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December 2004 Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor Armando GUEBUZA served two terms and then passed executive power to Filipe NYUSI in October 2014. RENAMO’s residual armed forces engaged in a low-level insurgency from 2012 to 2014.","overview":"Mozambique is a southern African nation whose long Indian Ocean coastline is dotted with popular beaches like Tofo as well as offshore marine parks.

The Bazaruto Archipelago farther south has reefs which protect rare marine life including dugongs.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":59,"land_mass_km":786380,"population_christian":13121000,"population_christian_percentage":56.1,"population_catholic_percentage":28.4,"population_protestant_percentage":27.7,"population_refugee":4708,"population_migration":-5000,"population_year_change":2.93,"population_density_km":40,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":38,"population_literacy_percentage":"55.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}}
