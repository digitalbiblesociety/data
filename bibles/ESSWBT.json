The Bering strait separated  the Yupic people and in 1959, when Wycliffe linguists Dave and Mitzi Shinen began their translation assignment to the Yupik-speaking Alaskan Eskimo, they were unable to collaborate with the Siberian Yupiks due to the Cold War being waged between the USSR and the USA. This changed in 1989, when a group of elated Yupiks from Siberia plowed their way through the freezing arctic sea in three walrus-skin boats to be reunited with their relatives at last.\n\nDuring the time of separation, the Siberians had developed a written form of Yupik, just as the Shinens had done with the same language for the St. Lawrence Islanders. But the Siberians, who had learned to read their Yupik written with a Russian Cyrillic alphabet, could not read Yupik written in the Roman alphabet, developed by the Shinens. In 2018, Dave and Mitzi published the New Testament in both alphabets with help from Jim Brase.","description_short":"In 2018, Dave and Mitzi published the New Testament in Cyrillic and Romanized Yupic alphabets with help from Jim Brase.","description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Cyrl","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null,"links":[{"bible_id":"ESSWBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ESSWYI","title":"NT","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ESSWBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"audio_web","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/ESSWYI","title":"NT","scope":null,"type":"audio_web","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","organization_id":"faith-comes-by-hearing","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ESSWBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"https://virtualstorehouse.org/collections/all-available-bibles/products/yupik-nt-ess-textured-cover-roman-alphabet","title":"","scope":"NT\r","type":"print","provider":"Virtual Storehouse","organization_id":"virtual-storehouse","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ESSWBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"https://virtualstorehouse.org/collections/all-available-bibles/products/yupik-nt-ess","title":"","scope":"NT\r","type":"print","provider":"Virtual Storehouse","organization_id":"virtual-storehouse","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ESSWBT","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"print","url":"https://virtualstorehouse.org/collections/all-available-bibles/products/yupik-nt-ess-cyrillic","title":"","scope":"NT\r","type":"print","provider":"Virtual Storehouse","organization_id":"virtual-storehouse","filesize":null,"response_code":null}],"pod":[{"bible_id":"ESSWBT","publisher_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","partner_id":null,"description":"This Bible is copyrighted by Wycliffe Bible Translators (Wycliffe.org) and is printed with permission by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org) for non-commercial use.<br /><br />This Bible is available for free download in a variety of digital formats at dbs.org/bibles.","trim":"us_letter","scope":"bible","pages":455,"print_ready":0,"print_banned":0,"portion":0,"columns":2,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":null,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"line_height":1.3,"counter_style":null,"justified":"0","justified_cjk":"0","cover_filter":null,"custom_styles":null},{"bible_id":"ESSWBT","publisher_id":"wycliffe-bible-translators-inc","partner_id":null,"description":"This Bible is copyrighted by Wycliffe Bible Translators (Wycliffe.org) and is printed with permission by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org) for non-commercial use.<br /><br />This Bible is available for free download in a variety of digital formats at dbs.org/bibles.","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":565,"print_ready":0,"print_banned":0,"portion":0,"columns":2,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":null,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"line_height":1.3,"counter_style":null,"justified":"0","justified_cjk":"0","cover_filter":null,"custom_styles":null}],"alphabet":{"script":"Cyrl","name":"Cyrillic","unicode_pdf":null,"family":"European","type":"alphabet","white_space":"between words","open_type_tag":"cyrl","complex_positioning":"no","requires_font":false,"unicode":true,"diacritics":false,"contextual_forms":null,"reordering":false,"case":null,"split_graphs":false,"status":"Current","baseline":"bottom","ligatures":"none","direction":"ltr","direction_notes":null,"sample":null,"sample_img":null,"description":"<p>The creation of the Cyrillic script is traditionally attributed to Saint Cyril, a missionary working in Bulgaria during the 9th century. He and his brother are also credited with the invention of the Glagolitic script, a derivation of the Greek cursive alphabet which was modified to fit the sound systems of Slavic languages. Some historians credit Clement of Ohrid, a student of Saint Cyrils, with creating the Cyrillic script as a more readable writing system based on Glagolitic. The Cyrillic script was initially used for writing Old Church Slavonic (also called Old Bulgarian), but it has undergone a number of changes since that time, so much so that the old and modern variants are considered by many to be two different but related scripts. Many of the modern letterforms differ from those used in early Cyrillic writing, some letters have been dropped, and new letters have been added. An orthographic reform was implemented by the Russian tsar Peter the Great in 1708 which removed a number of obsolete letters so that Russian writing is now almost perfectly phonetic.</p> <p>The script has traditionally been used for writing the Slavic languages, of which Russian is the most widely spoken. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, particularly under Soviet rule, it was extended to write over 50 languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia.</p> <p>Cyrillic is written from left to right with spaces between words. Upper- and lowercase letters are used; most printed lowercase letters are simply smaller versions of their uppercase equivalents. However, the shapes of handwritten and italic letters can vary greatly from the shapes of printed letters. With the conversion of the script to non-Slavic languages in which new sounds needed to be written, a number of <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#multig target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;digraphs, trigraphs and tetragraphs</a> were employed. Russian and the Slavic languages use only a few digraphs. Many new letters were also created for writing the non-Slavic languages by adding hooks, breves or diaereses to existing letters. These marks are not considered diacritics, instead, a letter so modified is considered a separate letter with the mark an intrinsic part.</p> <p>After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the languages which had been forced to adopt the Cyrillic script opted instead to give the Latin or Arabic script official status. However, at the end of 2002, President Putin signed into law an addition to Russian Federation law stipulating that the alphabets of the state language of the Russian Federation and the state languages of its republics must be based on the Cyrillic script. Other scripts for the alphabets of the state language of the Russian Federation and the state languages of its republics can only be adopted under federal laws. The law was received very negatively in some states.</p>"},"children":[{"id":"ESSWBTR","parent_bible_id":"ESSWBT","gbc":null,"date":"2018","iso":"ess","title":"Romanized Yupik New Testament","title_vernacular":"New Testament-et Akuzipigestun","copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"language":{"iso":"ess","glotto_id":"cent2128","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Central Siberian Yupik","autonym":"Siberian YupikYuit","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Eastern Russia","area":"Alaska, St. Lawrence Island, Gambell and Savonga villages.
