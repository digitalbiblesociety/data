{"abbr":"BJZWBT","title":"Baruga New Testament","title_vernacular":"God Da Gaga Reka Re","description":"The nearest town to the Baruga people of Papua New Guinea is a four-hour motorboat ride away. Baruga villages are close to a river and about eight miles from the ocean, so canoes are central to their livelihood. Every day the Baruga people eat fish. One of their primary ways of raising money for children’s school fees is catching crocodiles and selling their skins. They also catch large quantities of fish, smoke them to dry and preserve the meat, and sell them in town. Barugas maintain a vibrant culture and a strong identity despite being aware of and connected to the wider world through trips to town. Located in a firmly Anglican area, their faith and worship has grown to be an important part of their life. The influence of the gospel for the past 60 years is beginning to transform their culture in good ways so that sorcery and fear are not nearly as controlling as they once were. In their villages, one can often hear music of various kinds throughout the days and evenings. Barugas have integrated their traditional hand-drum music into worship. Local musicians are writing many new songs, both in drum and guitar music.","iso":"bjz","script":"Latn","year":2017,"country_id":"PG","copyright":"© 2017, Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"BJZWBT","url":"https://dbs.org/bibles/BJZWBT","title":"eBook Downloads","visible":true,"organization_id":"93619ca8-7f05-48dc-995c-6f46cdc94918"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"BJZWBT","equivalent_id":"53e7a0245117ad093ff321fa","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"BJZWBT","equivalent_id":"54416a525117ad56bafea91a","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"BJZWBT","publisher_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49","description":"This Bible is copyrighted by Wycliffe Bible Translators (Wycliffe.org) and is printed with permission by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org) for non-commercial use.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis Bible is available for free download in a variety of digital formats at dbs.org/bibles.","trim":"us_letter","scope":"bible","pages":322,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":10,"orphans":3,"widows":3,"columns":1,"line_height":1.25,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","UpdatedAt":"2023-10-20T18:14:45-05:00"},{"bible_abbr":"BJZWBT","publisher_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49","description":"This Bible is copyrighted by Wycliffe Bible Translators (Wycliffe.org) and is printed with permission by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org) for non-commercial use.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis Bible is available for free download in a variety of digital formats at dbs.org/bibles.","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":506,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"CrimsonPro-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"CrimsonPro-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":11,"orphans":3,"widows":3,"columns":1,"line_height":1.3,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-09T20:47:42-06:00","UpdatedAt":"2023-08-17T17:05:02-05:00"}],"language":{"iso":"bjz","glotto_id":"baru1269","name":"Baruga","autonym":"Bareji","level":"L","location":"Papua New Guinea, Map 16","country_id":"PG","latitude":-9.40132,"longitude":148.76141,"population":2230,"status_id":"5"},"country":{"id":"PG","name":"Papua New Guinea","name_long":"The Independent State of Papua New Guinea","population":7399757,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"PNG","continent_id":"OC","iso_num":598,"language_count":864,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK (south) in 1885.
