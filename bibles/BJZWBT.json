    "description": "The nearest town to the Baruga people of Papua New Guinea is a four-hour motorboat ride away. Baruga villages are close to a river and about eight miles from the ocean, so canoes are central to their livelihood. Every day the Baruga people eat fish. One of their primary ways of raising money for children’s school fees is catching crocodiles and selling their skins. They also catch large quantities of fish, smoke them to dry and preserve the meat, and sell them in town. Barugas maintain a vibrant culture and a strong identity despite being aware of and connected to the wider world through trips to town. Located in a firmly Anglican area, their faith and worship has grown to be an important part of their life. The influence of the gospel for the past 60 years is beginning to transform their culture in good ways so that sorcery and fear are not nearly as controlling as they once were. In their villages, one can often hear music of various kinds throughout the days and evenings. Barugas have integrated their traditional hand-drum music into worship. Local musicians are writing many new songs, both in drum and guitar music.",
