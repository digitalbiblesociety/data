These refinements maintain faithful accuracy to the original texts and provide a clear understanding of God’s Word to those who prefer more modern English standards. The long-established translation standard for the NASB remains the same as it always has been, that is to accurately translate the inspired Word of God from the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts into modern English that is clearly understandable today.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":null,"versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0,"links":[{"bible_id":"ENGNASB20","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"web","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/2692-nasb2020-new-american-standard-bible-nasb","title":"New American Standard Bible - NASB","scope":null,"type":"web","provider":"The Lockman Foundation","organization_id":"youversion","filesize":null,"response_code":null},{"bible_id":"ENGNASB20","bible_size_id":"FB","bible_link_type":"archive","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=a761ca71e0b3ddcf","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":null,"type":"archive","provider":"Digital Bible Library","organization_id":"digital-bible-library","filesize":null,"response_code":null}],"pod":[],"alphabet":null,"children":[],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"en","name":"English","autonym":null,"macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Cook Islands","area":null,"progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GB","latitude":"53.000000","longitude":"-1.000000","population":379000000,"status_id":null,"status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":null}
