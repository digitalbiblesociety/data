There were four gospels comprising the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), and these are the main sources of information about the life of Jesus. Bible studies itself draws on many disciplines ranging from archaeology, ancient history, cultural backgrounds, textual criticism, literary criticism, historical backgrounds, philology, and social science. As to philology for example, most of the Hebrew Bible, the Tanakh, which formed the basis of the Christian Old Testament, was written in Biblical Hebrew, with a few chapters rendered in Biblical Aramaic.",
