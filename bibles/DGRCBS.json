{"abbr":"DGRCBS","title":"Dogrib New Testament and Genesis","title_vernacular":"Nǫ̀htsı̨̨ Nı̨̨htł'è","description":"This translation includes the book of Genesis and the New Testament in Tłı̨chǫ. The first edition of the Tłı̨chǫ New Testament was published in 2003. It was a historic event, as it was the first time in more than a hundred years that a complete New Testament was published for one of the Dene First Nations in the Territories. The first edition was well received and quickly sold out. In the meantime the book of Genesis had been completed. Consequently, the 2008 reprint of the Tłı̨chǫ New Testament included Genesis.\u003cbr\u003eThough this translation of the New Testament and Genesis took a total of ten years, the people who worked on it built on years of labor invested by the Tłı̨chǫ people, elders, priests and missionaries, translators, educators, and linguists. The material contained in this book was checked and approved by consultants from Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Canadian Bible Society. \u003cbr\u003e Dogrib Genesis and New Testament © 2003, 2008 Canadian Bible Society.","iso":"dgr","script":"Latn","year":2009,"country_id":"CA","copyright":"© 2009 Canadian Bible Society","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"DGRCBS","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/DGRCBS/LUK/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":false,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"DGRCBS","url":"http://live.bible.is/bible/DGRCBS/LUK/1","title":"Audio Bible","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":false,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"DGRCBS","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/DGRCBS","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":false,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"DGRCBS","url":"https://live.bible.is/bible/DGRCBS","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"audio_web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Faith Comes By Hearing","visible":false,"organization_id":"2c3d2807-1559-4187-a15e-c8bb07ba3c7a"},{"bible_abbr":"DGRCBS","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/800-dnt08-nohtsi-nihtl-e","title":"Nǫ̀htsı̨ Nı̨htł'è","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"DGRCBS","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/dogrib-genesis-new-testament","title":"Dogrib Genesis \u0026amp;
