This settlement pattern accounts for the complex linguistic diversity found on the archipelago to this day. The British and French who settled the New Hebrides in the 19th century agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French Condominium which administered the islands until independence in 1980 when the new name of Vanuatu was adopted.","overview":"Vanuatu is a South Pacific Ocean nation made up of roughly 80 islands that stretch 1300 kilometers. The islands offer scuba diving at coral reefs underwater caverns and wrecks such as the WWII-era troopship SS President Coolidge.
