After Bolivia Paraguay and Uruguay went their separate ways the area that remained became Argentina. The country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants from throughout Europe with Italy and Spain providing the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century much of Argentina's history was dominated by periods of internal political conflict between Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military factions. ++ After World War II an era of Peronist populism and direct and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) by force and has persisted despite numerous challenges the most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02 that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations of several presidents.","overview":"Argentina is a massive South American nation with terrain encompassing Andes mountains glacial lakes and Pampas grassland the traditional grazing ground of its famed beef cattle. The country is famous for tango dance and music. Its big cosmopolitan capital Buenos Aires is centered on the Plaza de Mayo lined with stately 19th-century buildings including Casa Rosada the iconic balconied presidential palace.","independent":1,"landmass_km":2736690,"population_christian":37561000,"population_christian_percentage":90,"population_catholic_percentage":77,"population_protestant_percentage":15,"population_refugee":3881,"population_migration":4800,"population_year_change":0.93,"population_density_km":17,"population_average_age":32,"population_urban_percentage":93,"population_literacy_percentage":98,"region_code":11,"region_id":419,"region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Argentina","url_national_society":"http://www.sba.org.ar/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/argentine-bible-society/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/argentina/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/AR-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/ARG","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/argentina.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/South_America/Argentina","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/argentina","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/argentina/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/AR","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/argentina.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/38510400","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Argentina_dload_hi.mov"}}
