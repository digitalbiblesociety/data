Just as Jesus taught us to pray for our daily bread, we can never simply live on yesterday’s bread, on the interpretations and translations of previous generations.” This New Testement is a compilation of all the work that Wright has done in his New Testament for Everyone series. The translation is supplemented by Wright’s pastoral anecdotes and scholarly insights. The New Testament for Everyone: Complete Eighteen-Volume Set is published by Westminster John Knox Press in 2011.",
