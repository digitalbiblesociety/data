It includes the prologues and arguments concerning the Pauline epistles, the Pauline epistles themselves, the Acts of the Apostles, the canonical epistles, and the Apocalypse. The text is preceded by a miniature (originally bound between folios seven and eight) depicting the Apostle Paul sitting on a throne in an aedicula (chapel). The two figures standing next to him, each holding a scroll, can be identified as his disciples Timothy and Titus. The groups of figures in the frame sections probably represent the churches to which the Pauline epistles were addressed, because later captions in the margins identify some of these people as Corinthians, Philippians, and Thessalonians. Coloring, conception, and design make this manuscript a typical example of the book production of Tegernsee in the 11th century. The fact that the codex was intensively used in later times is witnessed by supplements dating from the 13th century as well as the replacements for most of the original prologues. The miniature of Paul was partially overpainted in the 15th century.

It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"lat","glotto_id":"lati1261","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"la","name":"Latin","autonym":"lingua latīna","macroarea":null,"level":"A","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"VA","latitude":"41.902640","longitude":"12.450210","population":0,"status_id":"3","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"VA","name":"Holy See  Vatican","name_long":"The Holy See","population":1000,"official_language":"Latin","official_language_iso":"lat","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"VT","iso_a3":"VAT","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":336,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870 the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East sexual misconduct by clergy international development interreligious dialogue and reconciliation and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization.
