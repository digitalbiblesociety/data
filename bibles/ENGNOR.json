    "description": "Andrews Norton (December 31, 1786 â€“ September 18, 1853) was an American preacher and theologian.<br><br>In his early career, Andrews Norton helped to establish liberal Unitarianism in New England, and stridently opposed harshly conservative Calvinism and Trinitarianism. Nevertheless, later in life, he became the chief conservative Unitarian opponent of Transcendentalism. As a vocal and well-published theologian, he earned from some the joking title of \"the Unitarian Pope\".<br><br>He was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, son of Samuel Norton. Norton graduated from Harvard University in 1804 and continued as a graduate student and lecturer there and at Bowdoin College. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1815. He was named Dexter Lecturer on Biblical Criticism in 1813, and in 1819, Harvard made him the first Dexter Professor of Sacred Literature, a position he held until 1830; he also served as Harvard College Librarian from 1813 to 1821.<br><br>He opposed himself to the rise of Transcendentalism and insisted on the truth of some of the Biblical miracles, while rejecting \"most of those in the Old Testament, and a few in the new\", including rejecting the virgin birth.",
