A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of the next six decades repressive governments ran the country. In 1974 a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms. The following year Portugal granted independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986.","overview":"'Portugal is a southern European country on the Iberian Peninsula bordering Spain. Its location on the Atlantic Ocean has influenced many aspects of its culture: salt cod and grilled sardines are national dishes the Algarve''s beaches are a major destination and much of the nation’s architecture dates to the 1500s–1800s when Portugal had a powerful maritime empire.'","independent":1,"landmass_km":91590,"population_christian":10110000,"population_christian_percentage":84.3,"population_catholic_percentage":81,"population_protestant_percentage":3.3,"population_refugee":2387,"population_migration":-6000,"population_year_change":-0.29,"population_density_km":111,"population_average_age":46,"population_urban_percentage":66,"population_literacy_percentage":96,"region_code":10,"region_id":39,"region_name":"Southern Europe","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Portugal","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/portugal/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/PO-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/PRT","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/portugal.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Europe/Portugal","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/portugal","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/portugal/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/PT","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/portugal.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/22719704","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Portugal_dload_hi.mov"}}
