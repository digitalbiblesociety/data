    "description": "Drehu was first written in the Latin script by the Polynesian and English missionaries of the London Missionary Society during the 1840s, with the help of the natives. The first complete Bible was published in 1890. The Bible writing system didn't distinguish between the dental (written \"d\", \"t\") and the alveolar/retroflex (\"dr\" and \"tr\") consonants, which for a long time were written indifferently \"d\" and \"t\". In Drehu /ฮธ/ and /รฐ/ are not dental but interdental consonants. The new writing system was created during the 1970s.",
