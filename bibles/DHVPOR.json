{"abbr":"DHVPOR","title":"Bible Portions in Dehu","description":"Drehu was first written in the Latin script by the Polynesian and English missionaries of the London Missionary Society during the 1840s, with the help of the natives. The first complete Bible was published in 1890. The Bible writing system didn't distinguish between the dental (written \"d\", \"t\") and the alveolar/retroflex (\"dr\" and \"tr\") consonants, which for a long time were written indifferently \"d\" and \"t\". In Drehu /θ/ and /ð/ are not dental but interdental consonants. The new writing system was created during the 1970s.","iso":"dhv","script":"Latn","year":1890,"country_id":"NC","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","url":"https://archive.org/download/DHVPOR_DBS_HS/Dehu-Genesis-Portion-(Tusi-Hnapane-I-Mose).pdf","title":"Dehu - Genesis Portion","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"409475","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"d3950ccc-dc18-4e63-92c2-a0f5e2eef6ac"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","url":"https://archive.org/download/DHVPOR_DBS_HS/Dehu-John-(book).pdf","title":"Dehu - John (Book)","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"14767111","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"5461ddb85117ad12e24f6235","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"5461ddb85117ad131f639894","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"547343d85117ad44eb6a3da3","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"547343d95117ad44b2fa273b","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"547343da5117ad44b2fa273d","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"547343da5117ad44eb6a3da5","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"547343db5117ad44eb6a3da7","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"547343db5117ad46c3bf05b4","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DHVPOR","equivalent_id":"547343d95117ad46c3bf05b2","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"language":{"iso":"dhv","glotto_id":"dehu1237","name":"Dehu","level":"L","location":"New Caledonia","area":"Lifou, Loyalty Islands.","country_id":"NC","latitude":-20.88918,"longitude":167.22924,"population":13000,"status_id":"4"},"country":{"id":"NC","name":"New Caledonia","name_long":"New Caledonia","population":293608,"official_language":"French","official_language_iso":"fra","iso_a3":"NCL","continent_id":"OC","iso_num":540,"language_count":44,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century the island became a French possession in 1853. It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864.

The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2018 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.","overview":"'New Caledonia is a French territory comprising dozens of islands in the South Pacific.
