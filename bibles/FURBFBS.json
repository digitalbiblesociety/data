    "description": "Friulian, also called Friulan, and Friûl, is a Romance language, spoken in the Friuli region of north-eastern Italy, bordering Slovenia and Austria. The first book of Scriptures in Friulian was this Gospel of Mattew published in 1860 as Lu Vanzèli seònd S. Matìe (Il Vangelo secondo Matteo). It was translated into Friulian by Count Pietro dal Pozzo (volgarizzato in daletto Friulano dal Conte Pietro dal Pozzo). This gospel account was commissioned by Prince Louis Luciano Bonaparte. He was a great linguist who commissioned translations into lesser languages and dialects of Europe. He asked Pietro Zorutti to translate the gospel but he asked too much money, and he asked Abbott Iacopo Pirona, who recommended Conte (Count) Pietro dal Pozzo. Not much is known about him except that the had worked as an actuary at Udine from 1835 to 1844. The Gospel was published in 1860, with 250 copies, by Strangeways amp Walden, of 28 Castle Street, Leicester Square, London.  This was digitised for the Bible Society with the help of MissionAssist in 2021. ",
