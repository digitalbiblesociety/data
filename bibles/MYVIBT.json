In the early 17th century a new ROMANOV Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725) hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the Revolution of 1905 which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household. The communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53) strengthened communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. After defeating Germany in World War II as part of an alliance with the US (1939-1945) the USSR expanded its territory and influence in Eastern Europe and emerged as a global power. The USSR was the principal adversary of the US during the Cold War (1947-1991). The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the decades following Stalin’s rule until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize communism but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics. ++ Following economic and political turmoil during President Boris YELTSIN's term (1991-99) Russia shifted toward a centralized authoritarian state under the leadership of President Vladimir PUTIN (2000-2008 2012-present) in which the regime seeks to legitimize its rule through managed elections populist appeals a foreign policy focused on enhancing the country's geopolitical influence and commodity-based economic growth. Russia faces a largely subdued rebel movement in Chechnya and some other surrounding regions although violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus.","overview":"'Russia the world’s largest nation borders European and Asian countries as well as the Pacific and Arctic oceans.
