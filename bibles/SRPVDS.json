It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[{"id":"SRPB65","parent_bible_id":"SRPVDS","gbc":null,"date":"1865","iso":"srp","title":"Serbian Bible 1865 (Cyrillic)","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Cyrl","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"SRPL65","parent_bible_id":"SRPVDS","gbc":null,"date":"1865","iso":"srp","title":"Serbian Bible 1865 (Latin)","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"language":{"iso":"srp","glotto_id":"serb1264","glotto_family":null,"iso1":"sr","name":"Serbian","autonym":"српски / srpski","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","area":"Also in Albania, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Libya, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey (Europe), Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Zambia.","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"RS","latitude":"44.323844","longitude":"21.919184","population":7730000,"status_id":"1","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"RS","name":"Serbia","name_long":"The Republic of Serbia","population":6974289,"official_language":"Serbian","official_language_iso":"srp","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"RI","iso_a3":"SRB","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":688,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes was formed in 1918; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Communist Partisans resisted the Axis occupation and division of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1945 and fought nationalist opponents and collaborators as well. The military and political movement headed by Josip Broz \\\"TITO\\\" (Partisans) took full control of Yugoslavia when their domestic rivals and the occupiers were defeated in 1945. Although communists TITO and his successors (Tito died in 1980) managed to steer their own path between the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half decades. In 1989 Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the Republic of Serbia and his ultranationalist calls for Serbian domination led to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines. In 1991 Croatia Slovenia and Macedonia declared independence followed by Bosnia in 1992. The remaining republics of Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) in April 1992 and under MILOSEVIC's leadership Serbia led various military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring republics into a \\\"Greater Serbia.\\\" These actions were ultimately unsuccessful and after international intervention led to the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995. MILOSEVIC retained control over Serbia and eventually became president of the FRY in 1997. In 1998 an ethnic Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo provoked a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC government's rejection of a proposed international settlement led to NATO's bombing of Serbia in the spring of 1999. Serbian military and police forces withdrew from Kosovo in June 1999 and the UN Security Council authorized an interim UN administration and a NATO-led security force in Kosovo. FRY elections in late 2000 led to the ouster of MILOSEVIC and the installation of democratic government. In 2003 the FRY became the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro a loose federation of the two republics. Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo in March 2004 let to more intense calls to address Kosovo's status and the UN began facilitating status talks in 2006. In June 2006 Montenegro seceded from the federation and declared itself an independent nation. Serbia subsequently gave notice that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and Montenegro. In February 2008 after nearly two years of inconclusive negotiations Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia - an action Serbia refuses to recognize. At Serbia's request the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in October 2008 sought an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on whether Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence was in accordance with international law. In a ruling considered unfavorable to Serbia the ICJ issued an advisory opinion in July 2010 stating that international law did not prohibit declarations of independence. In late 2010 Serbia agreed to an EU-drafted UNGA Resolution acknowledging the ICJ's decision and calling for a new round of talks between Serbia and Kosovo this time on practical issues rather than Kosovo's status. The EU-moderated Belgrade-Pristina dialogue began in March 2011 and was raised to the level of prime ministers in October 2012. Serbia and Kosovo signed the first agreement of principles governing the normalization of relations between the two countries in April 2013 and are in the process of implementing its provisions.","overview":"'Serbia is a country on southeast Europe''s Balkan peninsula with northern plateaus and mountains with ski resorts to the south.
