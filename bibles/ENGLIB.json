{"abbr":"ENGLIB","title":"Liberal Translation of the New Testament","description":"Edward Harwood, A Liberal Translation of the New Testament; being An Attempt to translate the Sacred Writings with the same Freedom, Spirit, and Elegance, With which other English Translations from the Greek Classics have lately been executed: the Design and Scope of each Author being strictly and impartially explored, the True Signification and Force of the Original critically observed, and, as much as possible, transfused into our Language, and the Whole elucidated and explained upon a new and rational Plan: with select Notes, Critical and Explanatory. 2 Vols. London: for T. Becket and Others, 1768.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a paraphrase of the New Testament done by a classical scholar, Edward Harwood (1729-1794). His object was “To translate the sacred writers of the New Testament with the same freedom, impartiality, and elegance, with which other translations from the Greek classics have lately been executed, and to cloathe the genuine ideas and doctrines of the Apostles with that propriety and perspicuity, in which they themselves, I apprehend, would have exhibited them had they now lived and written in our language.” (Preface).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHarwood’s paraphrase imitates the verbose and ornate style of writing typical of much English prose of the eighteenth century, and has often been cited as an outstanding example of poor taste and inappropriate handling of Scripture. Shortly after its publication James Boswell called it a “ridiculous work.” 1 Others have called it “turgid,” “absurd,” and worse. In a discussion of the qualities of various English versions, Richard C. Trench wrote, “Of Harwood’s Liberal Translation of the New Testament (London, 1768), and the follies of it, not very far from blasphemous, it is unnecessary to give any specimens.” 2 J. Isaacs observes that Harwood’s version is “one of the most discussed and insulted” versions of the eighteenth century. 3 A specimen often quoted is the rendering of the Lord’s Prayer in Matthew 6.","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":1767,"country_id":"GB","copyright":"Public Domain","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGLIB","url":"https://archive.org/download/ENGLIB_DBS_HS/English-(1767)-Liberal-Translation-of-the-New-Testament-(Vol-1-2).pdf","title":"English (1767) Liberal Translation of the New Testament (Vol 1-2)","scope":"","type":"historic","filesize":"57956230","response_code":"0","provider":"The Bible Archive","visible":true,"organization_id":"0f04902f-a48b-4402-8eaa-899296cbb7ea"}],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000},"country":{"id":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","name_long":"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","population":67081000,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"GBR","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":826,"language_count":101,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe.
