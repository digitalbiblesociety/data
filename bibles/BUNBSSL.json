Originally the trade involved timber and ivory but later it expanded into slaves. Following the American Revolution a colony was established in 1787 and Sierra Leone became a destination for resettling black loyalists who had originally been resettled in Nova Scotia. After the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 British crews delivered thousands of Africans liberated from illegal slave ships to Sierra Leone particularly Freetown. The colony gradually expanded inland during the course of the 19th century; independence was attained in 1961. Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil war (1991-2002) that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people (about one third of the population). The military which took over full responsibility for security following the departure of UN peacekeepers at the end of 2005 has developed as a guarantor of the country's stability; the armed forces remained on the sideline during the 2007 and 2012 national elections. In March 2014 the closure of the UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone marked the end of more than 15 years of peacekeeping and political operations in Sierra Leone. The government's stated priorities include furthering development - including recovering from the Ebola epidemic - creating jobs and stamping out endemic corruption.","overview":"Sierra Leone is a country in West Africa on the Atlantic Ocean. It’s known for the white-sand beaches lining the Freetown Peninsula. The capital city Freetown commemorates the nation’s slave-trade history with the Cotton Tree landmark and King’s Yard Gate. Both were known as places of refuge for returned slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nearby Bunce Island was a key departure point during the slave trade.","independent":1,"landmass_km":72180,"population_christian":1294000,"population_christian_percentage":20.9,"population_refugee":443,"population_migration":-4200,"population_year_change":2.1,"population_density_km":111,"population_average_age":19,"population_urban_percentage":43,"population_literacy_percentage":46,"region_code":8,"region_id":202,"region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Sierra-Leone","url_national_society":"https://www.svetopismo.si/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/bible-society-of-slovenia/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/sierra-leone/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/SL-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/SLE","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/sierra_leone.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Africa/Sierra_Leone","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/sierra-leone","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/sierra-leone/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/SL","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/sierra-leone.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/70048099","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Sierra_Leone_dload_hi.mov"}}
