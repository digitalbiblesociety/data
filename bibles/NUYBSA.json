{"abbr":"NUYBSA","title":"The Numbulwar Wubuy New Testament with Portions","title_vernacular":"Ana-Maṉngulg Ana-Wubiba","description":"Early Bible translation work in Wubuy began with CMS Missionary Len Harris when he realised one of the languages, Wubuy, was widely understood around the Arnhem Land coast because its speakers, the Nunggubuyu people, were great travellers by canoe or across country. It was a kind of “lingua franca” in those days, so Len decided that it would be the best language into which to translate the Bible.  A MiniBible was printed in the early 1990’s, containing 70% of the New Testament and a small selection of Old Testament portions (Genesis 1-11, Ruth \u0026 Jonah). Continuing work by the Wubuy translators with assistance from Michael \u0026 Margaret Hore saw the dedication of the New Testament (along with Old Testament portions) at Numbulwar in September 2010.","iso":"nuy","script":"Latn","year":2010,"country_id":"AU","copyright":"© 2010 Bible Society of Australia","copyright_type":"CCBYNCND","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","url":"https://www.bible.com/en-GB/bible/1333/jhn.1.nuyntpo","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Wycliffe Global Alliance","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","url":"https://www.bibleshop.org.au/bibles/other-languages/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander/wubuy-new-testament-with-genesis-ruth-jonah.html","title":"Wubuy New Testament with Genesis, Ruth, Jonah","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible Society of Australia","visible":false,"organization_id":"4bf38bf9-78d0-415b-a3d8-1952b46edd3a"},{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/1333-nuyntpo-ana-mangulg-ana-wubiba-anu-gadhuwa-ana-lhaawu","title":"Ana-Maṉngulg Ana-Wubiba -- Anu-gadhuwa Ana-lhaawu","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Wycliffe Bible Translators, Inc.","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=957f2de259de7b0d","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":"NTP","type":"archive","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a"},{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","url":"https://ebible.org/find/details.php?id=nuybsa","title":"Simple HTML Bibles","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"ebible.org","visible":true,"organization_id":"583342a6-6914-4401-b670-83924dd3a1ae"},{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","url":"https://bible.com/versions/1333","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a","equivalent_id":"957f2de259de7b0d","site":"","suffix":"","type":"DBL","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=957f2de259de7b0d"},{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"1333","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/1333"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"NUYBSA","publisher_id":"048ddebe-a8fa-4370-914d-79a119447d49","description":" ","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":1061,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":10,"orphans":2,"widows":2,"columns":2,"line_height":1.3,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-02T22:09:49-05:00","UpdatedAt":"2023-08-17T23:34:08-05:00"}],"language":{"iso":"nuy","glotto_id":"nung1290","name":"Nunggubuyu","autonym":"Wubuy","level":"L","location":"Northern Australia","area":"Northern Territory, Numbulwar, east Arnhem Land.","country_id":"AU","latitude":-14.26229,"longitude":135.75267,"population":280,"status_id":"6b"},"country":{"id":"AU","name":"Australia","name_long":"The Commonwealth of Australia","population":25809973,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"AUS","continent_id":"OC","iso_num":36,"language_count":476,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Prehistoric settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia at least 40000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770 when Capt. James COOK took possession of the east coast in the name of Great Britain (all of Australia was claimed as British territory in 1829 with the creation of the colony of Western Australia). Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the Allied effort in World Wars I and II. ++ In recent decades Australia has become an internationally competitive advanced market economy due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s and its location in one of the fastest growing regions of the world economy. Long-term concerns include an aging population pressure on infrastructure and environmental issues such as floods droughts and bushfires. Australia is the driest inhabited continent on earth making it particularly vulnerable to the challenges of climate change. Australia is home to 10 per cent of the world's biodiversity and a great number of its flora and fauna exist nowhere else in the world.","overview":"Australia is a country and continent surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans.
