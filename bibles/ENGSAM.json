{"abbr":"ENGSAM","title":"Samaritan Pentateuch in English","description":"This landmark volume presents the first-ever English translation of the ancient Israelite Samaritan version of the Pentateuch, or Torah. A text of growing interest and importance in the field of biblical studies, the Samaritan Pentateuch preserves a version of the Hebrew text distinct from the traditional Masoretic Text that underlies modern Bible translations.\u003cbr\u003eBenyamim Tsedaka's expert English translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch is here laid out parallel to the more familiar Masoretic Text, highlighting the more than 6,000 differences between the two versions. In addition to extensive explanatory notes in the margins throughout, the book's detailed appendices show affinities between the Samaritan and Septuagint versions and between the Samaritan and Dead Sea Scroll texts. Concluding the volume is a categorical name index containing a wealth of comparative information.","iso":"eng","script":"Latn","year":2013,"country_id":"GB","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGSAM","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Israelite-Samaritan-Version-Torah-Translation/dp/0802865194","title":"Samaritian Pentateuch","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Amazon","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"ENGSAM","url":"https://www.stepbible.org/version.jsp?version=SPE","title":"Samaritian Pentateuch","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"StepBible","visible":true,"organization_id":"24370c46-46bb-47a2-8657-eb85ae0c3a6d"},{"bible_abbr":"ENGSAM","url":"https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=SP","title":"Crosswire Module","provider":"The Sword Project","visible":true,"organization_id":"dde7cec9-f63e-4370-b4b6-a841c44adda2"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"ENGSAM","organization_id":"dde7cec9-f63e-4370-b4b6-a841c44adda2","equivalent_id":"SP","site":"Crosswire","url":"https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=SP"}],"language":{"iso":"eng","glotto_id":"stan1293","iso1":"en","name":"English","level":"L","country_id":"GB","latitude":53,"longitude":-1,"population":379000000},"country":{"id":"GB","name":"United Kingdom","name_long":"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland","population":67081000,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","iso_a3":"GBR","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":826,"language_count":101,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.","overview":"The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe.
