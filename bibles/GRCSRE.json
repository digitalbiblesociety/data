{"abbr":"GRCSRE","title":"The Royal Greek New Testament","title_vernacular":"Editio Regia","description":"Editio Regia (Royal edition) is the third and the most important edition of the Greek New Testament of Robert Estienne (1503-1559). It is one of the most important representatives of the Textus Receptus, the first generation of printed editions of the Greek New Testament in history. It was named Editio Regia because of the beautiful and elegant Greek font it uses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was edited by Estienne in 1550 at Paris. It is the first Greek Testament that has a critical apparatus. Estienne entered on the margins of the pages variant readings from 15 Greek manuscripts as well as many readings from the Complutensian Polyglot. He designated all these sources by symbols from α' to ιϛ'. The Complutensian Polyglot was signified by α'. The critical collation was the new subject, and although Estienne omitted hundreds of important variants from used witnesses, it was a significant early step towards textual criticism of the New Testament. The oldest manuscript used in this edition was the Codex Bezae, which had been collated for him, \"by friends in Italy\" (secundo exemplar vetustissimum in Italia ab amicis collatum). The majority of these manuscripts are held in the National Library of France to the present day. Estienne made only a few changes in the Erasmian Novum Testamentum: for example, he added verse Luke 17:36, which he took from Codex Bezae.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe text of the editions of 1546 (first) and 1549 (second) was a composition of the Complutensian and Erasmian texts. The 1550 (third) edition (the Editio Regia proper) approaches more closely to the Erasmian fourth and fifth editions. According to John Mill, the first and second editions differ in 67 places, and the third in 284 places. The third edition became for many scholars, especially in England, the normative text of the Greek New Testament. It maintained this position until 1880. The 1551 (fourth) edition used exactly the same text as the third, without a critical apparatus, but the text is divided into numbered verses for the first time in the history of the printed text of Greek New Testament. It was used for the Geneva Bible.","iso":"grc","script":"Latn","year":1550,"country_id":"GR","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"GRCSRE","url":"http://bibletranslation.ws/down/TRStephens1550.pdf","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"pdf","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bibletranslation.ws","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"GRCSRE","url":"http://studybible.info/version/Stephanus","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"StudyBible.info","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"GRCSRE","url":"https://printedbooks.csntm.org/PrintedBook/Group/RobertusStephanusNovumTestamentum1550","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Csntm.org","visible":true},{"bible_abbr":"GRCSRE","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/1550-Stephanus-Greek-New-Testament-TR1550/#booklist","title":"NT","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"BibleGateway","visible":true,"organization_id":"9696ef31-b54c-4a20-82ab-f1b8a527e48a"},{"bible_abbr":"GRCSRE","url":"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo\u0026vid=69\u0026lang=53","title":"1550 Stephanus New Testament","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Bible Gateway","visible":true,"organization_id":"9696ef31-b54c-4a20-82ab-f1b8a527e48a"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"GRCSRE","organization_id":"583342a6-6914-4401-b670-83924dd3a1ae","equivalent_id":"GRCSRE","site":"ebible.org","suffix":"","type":"website","url":""}],"language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","level":"H","country_id":"GR","latitude":39.8155,"longitude":21.91293,"status_id":"10"},"country":{"id":"GR","name":"Greece","name_long":"The Hellenic Republic","population":10569703,"official_language":"Greek","official_language_iso":"ell","iso_a3":"GRC","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":300,"language_count":52,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century it gradually added neighboring islands and territories most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949 Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967 a group of military officers seized power establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981 Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late 2009 due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities. Since 2010 Greece has entered three bailout agreements with the European Commission the European Central Bank (ECB) the IMF and with the third the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The Greek Government agreed to its current $96 billion bailout in August 2015 which will conclude in August 2018.","overview":"'Greece is a country in southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas.
