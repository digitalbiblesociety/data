A. Scrivener, a well-respected late nineteenth century scholar.  The Textus Receptus (TR), also called the Received Text, is a printed Greek New Testament that is based on the vast majority of ancient hand-written New Testament manuscripts.  This massive quantity of manuscripts is called the Traditional or Byzantine Text.  The King James Version New Testament was translated from the Received Text.  The TR was first published in 1516.<br><br>This volume is similar to interlinears, in that it compares the Greek and English.  However, it differs with many interlinears in that it does not include a separate “literal” translation.  Interlinears often include a new translation or a so-called “literal” translation.  The implication is that the “literal” translation is more correct than the popular translation (such as the KJV), because it is “literal.”  However, literal does not always mean “literal.”  Most  Greek words can be translated in various ways, so the word chosen by the translator as the literal translation may actually not be the best word in the context.<br><br>Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener (1813 - 1891)) was a New Testament textual critic and a member of the English New Testament Revision Committee which produced the Revised Version of the Bible. He was prebendary of Exeter, and vicar of Hendon.<br><br>Graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 after studying at Southwark, he became a teacher of classics at a number of schools in southern England, and from 1846 to 1856 was headmaster of a school in Falmouth, Cornwall. He was also for 15 years rector of Gerrans, Cornwall.<br><br>Initially making a name for himself editing the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, Scrivener edited several editions of the New Testament and collated the Codex Sinaiticus with the Textus Receptus. For his services to textual criticism and the understanding of biblical manuscripts, he was granted a Civil list pension in 1872. He was an advocate of the Byzantine text (majority text) over more modern manuscripts as a source for Bible translations. He was the first to distinguish the Textus Receptus from the Byzantine text. Scrivener compared the Textus Receptus with the editions of Stephanus (1550), Theodore Beza (1565), and Elzevier (1633) and enumerated all the differences. In addition he identified the differences between the Textus Receptus and editions by Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf. Scrivener doubted the authenticity of texts like Matthew 16:2b–3, Christ's agony at Gethsemane, John 5:3.4, and the Pericope Adulterae.<br><br>In 1874, he became prebendary of Exeter and vicar of Hendon, where he remained for the rest of his life.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Grek","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0,"links":[{"bible_id":"GRCSCRI","bible_size_id":null,"bible_link_type":"historic","url":"https://archive.org/download/GRCSCRI_DBS_HS/Greek-English-(1882)-Scrivener-Parallel-New-Testament.pdf","title":"Greek-English (1882) Scrivener Parallel New Testament","scope":null,"type":"historic","provider":"The Bible Archive","organization_id":"archive-bible","filesize":56645055,"response_code":null}],"pod":[],"alphabet":{"script":"Grek","name":"Greek","unicode_pdf":null,"family":"European","type":"alphabet","white_space":"between words","open_type_tag":"grek","complex_positioning":"no","requires_font":false,"unicode":true,"diacritics":true,"contextual_forms":true,"reordering":null,"case":null,"split_graphs":null,"status":"Current","baseline":"bottom","ligatures":"optional","direction":"ltr","direction_notes":null,"sample":null,"sample_img":null,"description":"<p>The Greek script was the first documented writing system to represent consonants and vowels with distinct symbols, making it the oldest true alphabet. It has been used since the 8th century BC for writing the Greek language, and select letters are also currently used in writing mathematic and scientific concepts such as π (pi) and Ω (Ohm). Some symbols have been incorporated into the International Phonetic Alphabet. The script has also been used for writing a number of minority languages, including Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish.</p> <p>The Phoenician prince Cadmus is credited with introducing Phoenician writing to the Greeks, who then adapted it, most significantly by adding vowel letters, to write the Greek language. Historically, there were a number of variants of the alphabet, including an East/West variation. The Western variant was called Chalcidian, from which the Old Italic and Latin alphabets descended, and the Eastern variant was called Ionic, from which the modern Greek alphabet descended. A third variant, called the Attic script, was used in Athens until 400 BC, when they adopted the Ionic script. Subsequently the Ionic script became standard throughout Greece. At that time, Greek was written from right to left or in <a href=page.php?item_id=glossary#boust>boustrophedon</a> style, though it is now written from left to right.</p> <p>The alphabet currently contains twenty-four letters; six archaic letters have either been dropped or are now used as numerals. Some letters have variant forms. In writing the Greek language these variations are purely stylistic, although in mathematic and scientific contexts they can represent different concepts, for example ϖ, a variant form of pi, which is used in fluid dynamics to represent the angular frequency of a wave. The lower case sigma σ has a variant form, word-finally ς. Although this is a contextual form, it can be semantically significant; a word ending with σ must be an abbreviation of some other word having σ word-internally, whereas a word ending with ς must be a single non-abbreviated word.</p> <p>Historically, there were a number of ligatures used in Greek writing. Many of these have dropped from modern usage, although some remain, particularly in handwritten text and printed titles. The most common of these is the ligature ϗ̀, representing <span class=Em>και</span>, and.</p> <p>There have also been three accents used with Greek vowel letters: acute (<span class=Em>oxia</span>), grave (<span class=Em>varia</span>) and circumflex (<span class=Em>perispomeni</span>). In the early 80s, the Greek Government instituted a language reform which, among other things, introduced a single diacritic (<span class=Em>tonos</span>) in place of the three accent system. When two vowels form a diphthong, the accent is placed on the second vowel. Breathing marks were historically used but have fallen from current usage. Languages other than Greek sometimes use other diacritics for representing sounds which are not present in Greek.</p> <p>Greek spelling employs a number of <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#multig target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;digraphs</a> (pairs of letters used to represent a single sound), for example γγ which represents ŋɡ or ɡ, even though a single γ represents γ / j.</p> <p>Greek punctuation provided the basis for Latin punctuation so the two systems are similar, although a Greek middle dot symbol represents a semicolon, and a Greek question mark looks like a Latin semicolon.</p> <p>Bold type is used in Greek writing for titles, but rarely within a body of text. Inside text, expanded letterspacing is often used.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"grc","glotto_id":"anci1242","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Ancient Greek","autonym":"ἙλληνικήHellēnikḗ","macroarea":null,"level":"H","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"Full Bible\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"GR","latitude":"39.815500","longitude":"21.912930","population":0,"status_id":"10","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"GR","name":"Greece","name_long":"The Hellenic Republic","population":10569703,"official_language":"Greek","official_language_iso":"ell","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"GR","iso_a3":"GRC","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":300,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century it gradually added neighboring islands and territories most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949 Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967 a group of military officers seized power establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981 Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late 2009 due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities. Since 2010 Greece has entered three bailout agreements with the European Commission the European Central Bank (ECB) the IMF and with the third the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The Greek Government agreed to its current $96 billion bailout in August 2015 which will conclude in August 2018.","overview":"'Greece is a country in southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas.
