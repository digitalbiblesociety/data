It has been used since the 8th century BC for writing the Greek language, and select letters are also currently used in writing mathematic and scientific concepts such as π (pi) and Ω (Ohm). Some symbols have been incorporated into the International Phonetic Alphabet. The script has also been used for writing a number of minority languages, including Urum, Albanian Tosk, and Balkan Gagauz Turkish.</p> <p>The Phoenician prince Cadmus is credited with introducing Phoenician writing to the Greeks, who then adapted it, most significantly by adding vowel letters, to write the Greek language. Historically, there were a number of variants of the alphabet, including an East/West variation. The Western variant was called Chalcidian, from which the Old Italic and Latin alphabets descended, and the Eastern variant was called Ionic, from which the modern Greek alphabet descended. A third variant, called the Attic script, was used in Athens until 400 BC, when they adopted the Ionic script. Subsequently the Ionic script became standard throughout Greece. At that time, Greek was written from right to left or in <a href=page.php?item_id=glossary#boust>boustrophedon</a> style, though it is now written from left to right.</p> <p>The alphabet currently contains twenty-four letters; six archaic letters have either been dropped or are now used as numerals. Some letters have variant forms. In writing the Greek language these variations are purely stylistic, although in mathematic and scientific contexts they can represent different concepts, for example ϖ, a variant form of pi, which is used in fluid dynamics to represent the angular frequency of a wave. The lower case sigma σ has a variant form, word-finally ς. Although this is a contextual form, it can be semantically significant; a word ending with σ must be an abbreviation of some other word having σ word-internally, whereas a word ending with ς must be a single non-abbreviated word.</p> <p>Historically, there were a number of ligatures used in Greek writing. Many of these have dropped from modern usage, although some remain, particularly in handwritten text and printed titles. The most common of these is the ligature ϗ̀, representing <span class=Em>και</span>, and.</p> <p>There have also been three accents used with Greek vowel letters: acute (<span class=Em>oxia</span>), grave (<span class=Em>varia</span>) and circumflex (<span class=Em>perispomeni</span>). In the early 80s, the Greek Government instituted a language reform which, among other things, introduced a single diacritic (<span class=Em>tonos</span>) in place of the three accent system. When two vowels form a diphthong, the accent is placed on the second vowel. Breathing marks were historically used but have fallen from current usage. Languages other than Greek sometimes use other diacritics for representing sounds which are not present in Greek.</p> <p>Greek spelling employs a number of <a href=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?&cat_id=Glossary#multig target=_blank><img src=../sites/s/themes/default/_media/system_icons/offsite_link.png />&nbsp;digraphs</a> (pairs of letters used to represent a single sound), for example γγ which represents ŋɡ or ɡ, even though a single γ represents γ / j.</p> <p>Greek punctuation provided the basis for Latin punctuation so the two systems are similar, although a Greek middle dot symbol represents a semicolon, and a Greek question mark looks like a Latin semicolon.</p> <p>Bold type is used in Greek writing for titles, but rarely within a body of text. Inside text, expanded letterspacing is often used.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"cop","glotto_id":"copt1239","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Coptic","autonym":"ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ ~ ⲧⲙⲛ̄ⲧⲣⲙ̄ⲛ̄ⲕⲏⲙⲉ","macroarea":null,"level":"E","development":null,"use":null,"location":null,"area":"","progress":"New Testament\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"EG","latitude":"29.472030","longitude":"31.205300","population":0,"status_id":"9","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"EG","name":"Egypt","name_long":"The Arab Republic of Egypt","population":106437241,"official_language":"Arabic Standard","official_language_iso":"arb","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"EG","iso_a3":"EGY","continent_id":"AF","iso_num":818,"religion_primary":"Islam","introduction":"The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C. and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C. who in turn were replaced by the Greeks Romans and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882 but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922 Egypt acquired full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world) limited arable land and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's population through economic reform and massive investment in communications and physical infrastructure. ++ Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster. Egypt's military assumed national leadership until a new parliament was in place in early 2012; later that same year Mohammed MORSI won the presidential election. Following often violent protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MORSI's government and the Muslim Brotherhood the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MORSI from power in July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR. In January 2014 voters approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected Abdel Fattah EL SISI president. Egypt elected a new legislature in December 2015 the first parliament since 2012.","overview":"'Egypt a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East dates to the time of the pharaohs.
