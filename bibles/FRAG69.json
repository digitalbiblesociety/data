It plays an influential global role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council NATO the G-8 the G-20 the EU and other multilateral organizations. France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009 reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO. Since 1958 it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier more purely parliamentary administrations. In recent decades its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of Europe including the introduction of a common currency the euro in January 1999. In the early 21st century five French overseas entities - French Guiana Guadeloupe Martinique Mayotte and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper.","overview":"France in Western Europe encompasses medieval cities alpine villages and Mediterranean beaches.
