    "description": "Esperanto is an artificial language developed by Ludvic L. Zamenhof (1859-1917), a Jewish linguist from Lithuania, and used since 1887. It is the mostly widely used constructed language in the world. Zamenhof translated the Jewish Bible (Old Testament) from the Hebrew Masoretic text into Esperanto. It was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1910. The New Testament was translated a team of Esperanto speaking British clergy and scholars and completed in 1912. Scholars from the British and Foreign Bible Society harmonised the language between the Testaments. In 1926 BFBS printed these together as the La Sankta Biblio (The Holy Bible) often called the Londona Biblio (London Bible).",
