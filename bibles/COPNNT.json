    "description": "The Bohairic Coptic New Testament was one of the earliest translations of the Greek of the New Testament. But outside of Egypt, Coptic is not a widely known language these days—even among scholars of the New Testament. Thankfully, when George Horner prepared his critical editions of the Coptic text in the early 1900’s, he also prepared translations of the Sahidic and Bohairic versions for the edition. ",
