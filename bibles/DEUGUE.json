{"abbr":"DEUGUE","title":"Unrevised Elberfelder Bible","title_vernacular":"Darby Unrevidierte Elberfelder 1905","description":"German Unrevised Elberfelder Bible 1905. The Darby Bible in German is known as the \"Elberfelder Bibel\". Julius Anton von Poseck (1816–1896) had been translating some NT Epistles into German. In 1851 he sent his work in progress to Darby for review. This stimulated Darby to begin work in 1854 on a full translation and he proceeded on the German translation with von Poseck and Carl Brockhaus (1822–1899). The German NT was published in 1855. When von Poseck moved to England in 1857, the Old Testament translation was made by Darby, Brockhaus and a Dutch Hebraist, Hermanus Cornelis Voorhoeve (1837–1901). The OT work commenced 1869 and was completed in 1871, when the whole Bible was published. Since then there have been a number of significant updates and revisions, including the revisions in 1960, 1975, 1985 by R. Brockhaus Verlag Elberfeld (entitled: \"Elberfelder Bibel\") and most recently in 2003 by Christliche Schriftenverbreitung Hückeswagen (entitled: \"Elberfelder Übersetzung, Edition CSV Hückeswagen\").","iso":"deu","script":"Latn","year":1905,"country_id":"DE","copyright":"Public Domain","copyright_type":"OPEN","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"DEUGUE","url":"https://dbs.org/bibles/DEUGUE","title":"eBook Downloads","visible":true,"organization_id":"93619ca8-7f05-48dc-995c-6f46cdc94918"},{"bible_abbr":"DEUGUE","url":"https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=GerElb1905","title":"Crosswire Module","provider":"The Sword Project","visible":true,"organization_id":"dde7cec9-f63e-4370-b4b6-a841c44adda2"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"DEUGUE","organization_id":"dde7cec9-f63e-4370-b4b6-a841c44adda2","equivalent_id":"GerElb1905","site":"Crosswire","url":"https://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=GerElb1905"}],"bible_pod":[{"bible_abbr":"DEUGUE","publisher_id":"256782d5-3b7e-4583-bd9f-3f8e356df67a","description":"This Bible is in the Public Domain and is produced at cost by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis Bible, and many others, are available for free download in a variety of digital formats at dbs.org/bibles.","trim":"us_letter","scope":"bible","pages":806,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"NotoSans-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"NotoSans-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":10,"orphans":3,"widows":3,"columns":2,"line_height":1.25,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","UpdatedAt":"2023-10-20T19:05:35-05:00"},{"bible_abbr":"DEUGUE","publisher_id":"256782d5-3b7e-4583-bd9f-3f8e356df67a","description":"This Bible is in the Public Domain and is produced at cost by the Digital Bible Society (dbs.org).\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis Bible, and many others, are available for free download in a variety of digital formats at dbs.org/bibles.","trim":"us_trade","scope":"bible","pages":1512,"print_ready":false,"print_banned":false,"portion":false,"font":"CrimsonPro-Regular.ttf","font_bold":"CrimsonPro-Bold.ttf","font_format":"truetype","font_size":9,"orphans":3,"widows":3,"columns":2,"line_height":1,"justified":false,"justified_cjk":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-09T20:47:42-06:00","UpdatedAt":"2023-08-17T18:02:56-05:00"}],"language":{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","level":"L","location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"DE","latitude":48.648954,"longitude":12.467623,"population":76100000,"status_id":"1"},"country":{"id":"DE","name":"Germany","name_long":"The Federal Republic of Germany","population":79903481,"official_language":"German Standard","official_language_iso":"deu","iso_a3":"DEU","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":276,"language_count":104,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia) Germany is a key member of the continent's economic political and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US UK France and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations the EC which became the EU and NATO while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999 Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency the euro.","overview":"Germany is a Western European country with a landscape of forests rivers mountain ranges and North Sea beaches.
