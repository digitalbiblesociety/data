    "description": "German Unrevised Elberfelder Bible 1905. The Darby Bible in German is known as the \"Elberfelder Bibel\". Julius Anton von Poseck (1816–1896) had been translating some NT Epistles into German. In 1851 he sent his work in progress to Darby for review. This stimulated Darby to begin work in 1854 on a full translation and he proceeded on the German translation with von Poseck and Carl Brockhaus (1822–1899). The German NT was published in 1855. When von Poseck moved to England in 1857, the Old Testament translation was made by Darby, Brockhaus and a Dutch Hebraist, Hermanus Cornelis Voorhoeve (1837–1901). The OT work commenced 1869 and was completed in 1871, when the whole Bible was published. Since then there have been a number of significant updates and revisions, including the revisions in 1960, 1975, 1985 by R. Brockhaus Verlag Elberfeld (entitled: \"Elberfelder Bibel\") and most recently in 2003 by Christliche Schriftenverbreitung Hückeswagen (entitled: \"Elberfelder Übersetzung, Edition CSV Hückeswagen\").",
