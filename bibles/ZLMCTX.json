In 1948 the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula except Singapore formed the Federation of Malaya which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore as well as Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo joined the Federation. The first several years of the country's independence were marred by a communist insurgency Indonesian confrontation with Malaysia Philippine claims to Sabah and Singapore's withdrawal in 1965. During the 22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR bin Mohamad (1981-2003) Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from dependence on exports of raw materials to the development of manufacturing services and tourism. Prime Minister Mohamed NAJIB bin Abdul Razak (in office since April 2009) has continued these pro-business policies.","overview":"'Malaysia is a Southeast Asian country occupying parts of the Malay Peninsula and the island of Borneo.
