An armed neutrality was preserved in both world wars. Sweden's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system intermixed with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000-02 and 2009 by the global economic downturns but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Sweden joined the EU in 1995 but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a 2003 referendum.","overview":"Sweden is a Scandinavian nation with thousands of coastal islands and inland lakes along with vast boreal forests and glaciated mountains. Its principal cities eastern capital Stockholm and southwestern Gothenburg and Malmö are all coastal. Stockholm is built on 14 islands. It has more than 50 bridges as well as the medieval old town Gamla Stan royal palaces and museums such as open-air Skansen.","independent":1,"landmass_km":410340,"population_christian":6292000,"population_christian_percentage":65,"population_catholic_percentage":2,"population_protestant_percentage":63,"population_refugee":253794,"population_migration":40000,"population_year_change":0.63,"population_density_km":25,"population_average_age":41,"population_urban_percentage":88,"population_literacy_percentage":99,"region_code":10,"region_id":154,"region_name":"Northern Europe","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Sweden","url_national_society":"http://www.bibelsallskapet.se/","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/swedish-bible-society/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/sweden/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/SW-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/SWE","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/sweden.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Europe/Sweden","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/sweden","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/sweden/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/SE","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/sweden.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/38925800","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Sweden_dload_hi.mov"}}
