{"abbr":"CMNGJN","title":"The Griffith New Testament","title_vernacular":"杨格非译本","description":"In the late Qing Dynasty, missionaries sought to improve the readability of Bible translations using simple Chinese. In 1877, John Griffith proposed the translation of the Bible in easy to read Chinese at the Missionary Conference in China.  Although John Griffith did not intend to continue the translation, he eventually completed the translation of the four gospels, which was published in 1884.  John Griffith used the Greek as a blueprint, referring to the \"Beijing Mandarin Translation\", \"Commissioned Translations\" and the translations of Pizhiwen and Kelongcun.  Some people criticized this translation, thinking that it was a free translation, or suspected that John Griffith just converted the \"Beijing Mandarin Translation\" into a simple Chinese version.  John Griffith cooperated with some missionaries from Britain, the United States, and Germany to revise the translation.","iso":"cmn","script":"Hant","year":1887,"country_id":"CN","copyright":"Public

After World War II the communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that while ensuring China's sovereignty imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978 MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded yet political controls remain tight. Since the early 1990s China has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.","overview":"'China is a populous nation in East Asia whose vast landscape encompasses grassland desert mountains lakes rivers and more than 14000km of coastline.
