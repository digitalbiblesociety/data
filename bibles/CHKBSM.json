The eastern four island groups adopted a constitution in 1979 and chose to become the Federated States of Micronesia. (The westernmost island group became Palau.) Independence came in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the US which was amended and renewed in 2004. Present concerns include large-scale unemployment overfishing overdependence on US foreign aid and state perception of inequitable allocation of US aid.","overview":"The Federated States of Micronesia is a country spread across the western Pacific Ocean comprising more than 600 islands. Micronesia is made up of 4 island states: Pohnpei Kosrae Chuuk and Yap. The country is known for palm-shaded beaches wreck-filled dives and ancient ruins including Nan Madol sunken basalt temples and burial vaults that extend out of a lagoon on Pohnpei.","independent":1,"landmass_km":700,"population_christian":106000,"population_christian_percentage":95.4,"population_refugee":4,"population_migration":-600,"population_year_change":1.06,"population_density_km":164,"population_average_age":24,"population_urban_percentage":21,"population_literacy_percentage":89,"region_code":1,"region_id":57,"region_name":"Micronesia","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Micronesia-republic-Pacific-Ocean","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/micronesia-partnership/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/micronesia-federated-states-of/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/FM-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/FSM","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/micronesia.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Oceania/Micronesia%2C_Federated_States_of","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/micronesia-federated-states-of","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/micronesia/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/FM","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/micronesia.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/79902655","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Micronesia_dload_hi.mp4"}}
