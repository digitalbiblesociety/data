The language was unwritten until the arrival of missionaries from the New Hebrides Mission.  Matthew, Jonah, Haggai, Malachi 1904: James Sandilands was a missionary with the New Hebrides Mission. He translated Matthew, Jonah, Haggai and Malachi. These were published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1904.  Acts 1906: Another missionary with the New Hebrides Mission, Charles E. Yates translated the book of Acts into Tolomaku and this was published by the Melbourne Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1906.  John, Philippians, 1 and 2 Timothy 1909: Charles E. Yates then worked on the Gospel of John, the Letter to the Philippians and the 1st and 2nd Letters to Timothy. With the help of fifteen of his teaching staff they translated “Na Taveti Tahonai hi Jon na Varisula” and 750 copies were published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1909.  Digital Edition: These texts were digitised from original copies in the British and Foreign Bible Society archives at Cambridge. They were combined together as the Tolomaku Bible Portions in 2018.
