{"abbr":"HYEAMB","title":"Armenian Mekhitar BIble","title_vernacular":"Աստուածաշունչ","description":"In 1717 a young Armenian Catholic priest, Mekhitar Sebastatsi (Mekhitar of Sebastia [present-day Sivas, Turkey], 1676‒1749), founded a Benedictine Armenian Catholic Monastery on the island of San Lazzaro in Venice. Dedicated to the education and enlightenment of his people and devoted to his religion, Mekhitar wrote and published several works that became sources of inspiration and intellectual renewal throughout the centuries that followed. The monastery itself became a center for Armenian learning and publishing, which it has remained to the present day. In 1733 Mekhitar published a handsome Bible that was in essence the same text, although with some editing, of the Oskan Bible, the first complete printing of the Bible in Armenian that was produced in 1666 by Oskan Erewants‘i (Oskan of Yerevan, 1614‒74) at his shop in Amsterdam. Mekhitar’s edition was the second reprint of the 1666 Bible; the first was done in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) in 1705. The book contains a set of hand-tipped print illustrations that were made especially for the 1733 edition.

Despite periods of autonomy over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman Byzantine Arab Persian and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia the Ottoman Empire instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian deaths. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918 but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. ++ Armenian leaders remain preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh a primarily Armenian-populated region assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994 when a cease-fire took hold ethnic Armenian forces held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding regions approximately 14 percent of Azerbaijan’s territory. The economies of both sides have been hurt by their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful resolution. ++ Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009 senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with Turkey aiming to secure an opening of the border but Turkey has not yet ratified the Protocols normalizing relations between the two countries. In January 2015 Armenia joined Russia Belarus and Kazakhstan as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union.","overview":"Armenia is a nation and former Soviet republic in the mountainous Caucasus region between Asia and Europe. Among the earliest Christian civilizations it’s defined by religious sites including the Greco-Roman Temple of Garni and 4th-century Etchmiadzin Cathedral headquarters of the Armenian Church. Khor Virap Monastery is a pilgrimage site near Mount Ararat a dormant volcano just across the border in Turkey.","independent":1,"landmass_km":28470,"population_christian":2826000,"population_christian_percentage":97.9,"population_protestant_percentage":97.9,"population_refugee":17985,"population_migration":-4998,"population_year_change":0.19,"population_density_km":104,"population_average_age":35,"population_urban_percentage":63,"population_literacy_percentage":99,"region_code":5,"region_id":145,"region_name":"Western Asia","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Armenia","url_national_society":"https://biblesociety.am/arm/1/Main","url_ubs":"https://unitedbiblesocieties.org/locations/bible-society-in-armenia/","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/armenia/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/AM-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/ARM","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/armenia.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Asia/Armenia","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/armenia","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/armenia/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/AM","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/armenia.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/22048631","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Armenia_dload_hi.mov"}}
