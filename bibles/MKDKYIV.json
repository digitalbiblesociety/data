{"abbr":"MKDKYIV","title":"Slavic Kyiv Gospel","title_vernacular":"Евангелие тетр (Киевское Евангелие)","description":"The Kyiv Gospel was created in 1411 by a monk called Makarii in the Pustynno-Mykolaivskyi Monastery in Kiev, by order of the monk Ionah Bolakyrev, as recorded in one of the historic inscriptions on the work. This copy is one of the few 15th-century manuscripts from Kiev that specifies where it was made. The Gospel is known as a paleographic specimen of the “younger” semi-uncial script in Ukraine. Two headpieces of simple composition, headings, and initials are executed in dark-brown ink and vermilion. The manuscript was restored and bound in the first quarter of the 16th century. The binding was restored again in 1721, and on the upper board appears the date \"June 4, 1721.\" The manuscript consists of the tetraevangelion (an ornate book of the Orthodox Church containing the text of the Gospels for liturgical readings), a menology (calendrical work commemorating the dead), and indices of lections. In the 19th century the manuscript was known as the Gospel of 1411. Four historic inscriptions were found in the manuscript, two of which were on folios (1 and 324) that are now missing. These inscriptions, known only from the investigations of N.V. Geppener and I.I. Sreznevsky, indicate the names of the scribe and the person who commissioned the original manuscript (note of June 20, 1411, folio 1 recto) and tell of a contribution made by unknown prince (note of March 23, 1427, folio 324 recto). One of two surviving inscriptions tells of another donation (folio 323 recto); the other is the 1721 note of the book binder. The manuscript is in the collection of the V.I. Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine.

Greek objection to Macedonia’s name insisting it implies territorial pretensions to the northern Greek province of the same name and democratic backsliding have stalled the country’s movement toward Euro-Atlantic integration. Immediately after Macedonia declared independence Greece sought to block Macedonian efforts to gain UN membership if the name “Macedonia” was used. Macedonia was eventually admitted to the UN in 1993 as “The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” and at the same time it agreed to UN-sponsored negotiations on the name dispute. In 1995 Greece lifted a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize relations but the issue of the name remained unresolved and negotiations for a solution are ongoing. Since 2004 the US and over 130 other nations have recognized Macedonia by its constitutional name Republic of Macedonia. Ethnic Albanian grievances over perceived political and economic inequities escalated into an insurgency in 2001 that eventually led to the internationally brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement (OFA) which ended the fighting and established guidelines for constitutional amendments and the creation of new laws that enhanced the rights of minorities. Relations between Macedonians and ethnic Albanians remain fragile however. ++ Macedonia has been engulfed in a political crisis that began after the 2014 legislative and presidential election and which escalated in 2015 when opposition party began releasing wiretap content that it alleged showed widespread government corruption. Although Macedonia became an EU candidate in 2005 the country still faces challenges including overcoming the political crisis fully implementing OFA resolving the outstanding name dispute with Greece improving relations with Bulgaria halting democratic backsliding and stimulating economic growth and development. At the 2008 NATO Summit in Bucharest Romania the Allies agreed that Macedonia would be invited to join the Alliance as soon as a mutually acceptable resolution to the name dispute was reached with Greece.","overview":"Macedonia officially the Republic of Macedonia is a country in the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe.
