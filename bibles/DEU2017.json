{"abbr":"DEU2017","title":"German Good News Translation","title_vernacular":"GBS Die Bibel: Lutherbibel Revidiert","description":"Recommended by the Evangelical Church in Germany for Protestants both in religious education and Bible translation Martin Luther was keen on making the Bible accessible to the German people, this translation does just that for the modern germanophone person. An updated German translation of the Bible, it retains in many places Luther's language, however unintelligible or ambiguous terms have been adapted to modern German giving it at once a timeless and modern feel. This edition includes the apocrypha for both scholarly and religious purposes for those interested in the text.","iso":"deu","script":"Latn","year":2017,"country_id":"DE","copyright":"© Tyndale House Publishers","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/german-luther-1912-gothic-jubilaums-bible","title":"German Luther (1912) Gothic Jubilaums Bible","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/german-luther-bible-2017","title":"German Luther Bible (2017)","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/german-luther-bible-2017-3","title":"German Luther Bible (2017)","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/german-luther-bible-2017-2","title":"German Luther Bible (2017)","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/german-luther-bible-2017-with-deuterocanonical-books","title":"German Luther Bible (2017) with Deuterocanonical Books","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"},{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","url":"https://www.biblescanada.com/german-luther-bible-2017-with-the-deuterocanonical-books-large-print","title":"German Luther Bible (2017) with the Deuterocanonical Books, Large print","scope":"","type":"print","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Canadian Bible Society","visible":true,"organization_id":"8b95eaec-c9fa-4fb9-a748-50edf5d28d9c"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","equivalent_id":"53eb29455117ad1a9b404999","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","equivalent_id":"53eb29465117ad1b19b71fbe","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"},{"bible_abbr":"DEU2017","equivalent_id":"53eb29475117ad1a4f89d6c0","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"language":{"iso":"deu","glotto_id":"stan1295","iso1":"de","name":"German","autonym":"Deutsch","level":"L","location":"Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands","area":"Also in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russian Federation (Europe), Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United States, Uruguay, Uzbekistan.","country_id":"DE","latitude":48.648954,"longitude":12.467623,"population":76100000,"status_id":"1"},"country":{"id":"DE","name":"Germany","name_long":"The Federal Republic of Germany","population":79903481,"official_language":"German Standard","official_language_iso":"deu","iso_a3":"DEU","continent_id":"EU","iso_num":276,"language_count":104,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia) Germany is a key member of the continent's economic political and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US UK France and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations the EC which became the EU and NATO while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999 Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency the euro.","overview":"Germany is a Western European country with a landscape of forests rivers mountain ranges and North Sea beaches.
