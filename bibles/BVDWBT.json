Some of the most bitter fighting of World War II occurred on this archipelago. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and independence two years later. Ethnic violence government malfeasance and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil society. In June 2003 then Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order; the following month an Australian-led multinational force arrived to restore peace and disarm ethnic militias. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has generally been effective in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions.","overview":"The Solomon Islands a nation of hundreds of islands in the South Pacific has many WWII-era sites. Guadalcanal a province and one of the archipelago’s largest islands honors fallen Allied soldiers at its U.S. War Memorial. Guadalcanal is also home to the nation’s capital Honiara whose bustling Central Market showcases the islands’ produce and traditional handicrafts.","independent":1,"landmass_km":27990,"population_refugee":3,"population_migration":-1600,"population_year_change":2.55,"population_density_km":25,"population_average_age":20,"population_urban_percentage":23,"population_literacy_percentage":97,"region_code":1,"region_id":54,"region_name":"Melanesia","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands","url_britannica":"https://www.britannica.com/place/Solomon-Islands","url_factbook":"https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/solomon-islands/","url_factbook_pdf":"https://images.bible.cloud/maps/summary/BP-summary.pdf","url_human_development":"https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/specific-country-data#/countries/SLB","url_nations_online":"https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/solomon_islands.htm","url_odp":"https://curlie.org/Regional/Oceania/Solomon_Islands","url_operation_world":"https://operationworld.org/locations/solomon-islands","url_religious_freedom":"https://www.state.gov/countries-areas/solomon-islands/","url_joshua":"https://joshuaproject.net/countries/SB","url_prayercast":"https://prayercast.com/solomon-islands.html","url_prayercast_video":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/81214902","url_prayercast_download":"http://www.prayercast.com/downloads/direct_download.php?file=Solomon_Islands_dload_hi.mp4"}}
