Hsiao，1898-1984），原名蕭思承，湖南長沙人，早年赴美國留學，回國後就任北京大學教授。在抗日戰爭期間，他任職於大本營，戰後出任中國駐日本代表團首席顧問。後來棄政從文，並潛心譯經。 1959年，蕭鐵笛開始翻譯新約，特別注重文筆風格，將其譯成優雅的國語；據說是以希臘文《亞歷山太抄本》（Codex Alexandrinus）為基礎。每卷書前附有作者及書卷簡介。書卷譯名與和合本稍有不同，最明顯的是使徒的名字冠以聖字。譯稿由趙世光牧師審定，最終取名為《新譯新約全集》，在1967年8月。本數碼化工作也以這初版為依據。後來，蕭鐵笛旅居日本，創立日本聖書研究會，並修訂《新譯新約全集》初版。修訂版於他離世後在橫濱出版出版（1986年）。此修訂版是在《和合本》完成之後，惟一沒有使用『洗』字，而用『浸』字的非浸禮宗譯本。","iso":"cmn","script":"Hant","year":1967,"country_id":"CN","copyright":"© United Bible Societies","bible_links":[{"bible_abbr":"CMNTHNT","url":"https://www.bible.com/versions/2032-%E8%95%AD%E9%90%B5%E7%AC%9B%E8%AD%AF%E6%9C%AC-%E8%95%AD%E9%90%B5%E7%AC%9B%E6%96%B0%E8%AD%AF%E6%96%B0%E7%B4%84%E5%85%A8%E6%9B%B8","title":"蕭鐵笛《新譯新約全書》","scope":"","type":"web","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"United Bible Societies","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"},{"bible_abbr":"CMNTHNT","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=63dc3f8912b3bd1e","title":"Bible For Developers","scope":"NT","type":"archive","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"Digital Bible Library","visible":true,"organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a"},{"bible_abbr":"CMNTHNT","url":"https://bible.com/versions/2032","title":"Youversion","scope":"","type":"","filesize":"0","response_code":"0","provider":"","visible":true,"organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72"}],"bible_equivalents":[{"bible_abbr":"CMNTHNT","organization_id":"f4b27cf8-7dbf-4bfb-8cd4-93315e272e2a","equivalent_id":"63dc3f8912b3bd1e","site":"","suffix":"","type":"DBL","url":"https://app.thedigitalbiblelibrary.org/entry?id=63dc3f8912b3bd1e"},{"bible_abbr":"CMNTHNT","organization_id":"a4f1fc26-64a5-412f-804d-d91da40aee72","equivalent_id":"2032","site":"","suffix":"","type":"","url":"https://bible.com/versions/2032"},{"bible_abbr":"CMNTHNT","equivalent_id":"53ac24395117ad56de235548","type":"Archive","url":"globalbiblecatalogue.org"}],"language":{"iso":"cmn","glotto_id":"mand1415","iso1":"zh","name":"Mandarin Chinese","autonym":"普通话‎","level":"L","location":"China","area":"Widespread north of Changjiang River, a belt south of the Changjiang from Qiujiang (Jiangxi) to Zhenjiang (Jiangsu), Hubei, except southeast corner, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, northwest part of Guangxi, and northwest corner of Hunan.

After World War II the communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic socialist system that while ensuring China's sovereignty imposed strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of millions of people. After 1978 MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by 2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population living standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal choice has expanded yet political controls remain tight. Since the early 1990s China has increased its global outreach and participation in international organizations.","overview":"'China is a populous nation in East Asia whose vast landscape encompasses grassland desert mountains lakes rivers and more than 14000km of coastline.
