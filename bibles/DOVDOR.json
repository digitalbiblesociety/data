It is also the script used for writing a number of Romance, Germanic, Baltic and non-Indo-European languages, as well as the <a href=http://scriptsource.org/entry/ucgb77fkvh>International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>.</p> <p>The script was derived from the Western variant of the Greek alphabet. The earliest extant inscription, an engraved brooch now in the ‘Museo Nazionale Preistorico Etnografico Luigi Pigorini’ in Rome, has been dated to the 7th century BC. The script developed slowly over the next thousand years, and by the 4th century AD many of the modern forms had been developed, and writing had settled into a consistent left to right direction. The Latin script was disseminated throughout western, northern and central Europe and the Baltic countries along with the Christian religion. However it was not until the colonization of the Americas, Australia, and parts of Asia, Africa and the Pacific that the script began to spread outside of Europe, carried by the English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch languages.</p> <p>As the script spread around the world, a number of language-specific amendments were made in order to accurately represent the sounds of various languages. These included ligatures, for example the German <span class=Em>esszett</span> ß, and a number of diacritics. Some languages also adapted the alphabet by the addition of entirely new letters, such as <span class=Em>eth</span> Ðð used in Faroese and Icelandic or <span class=Em>epsilon</span> Ɛɛ used in many Niger-Congo orthographies.</p> <p>The Latin script is bicameral; it is written using both upper- and lower-case letters. It is written horizontally from left to right. Each letter sits on the baseline, with some letters having descenders hanging below the baseline, and some having ascenders protruding beyond the x-height. The script also uses a set of punctuation, which is almost entirely consistent across European languages. Exceptions to this include different syles of quotation marks (“ ” and « »), the Greek question mark, which is identical to the semicolon in many other languages (;), and the Spanish inverted question/exclamation marks (¿ and ¡).</p> <p>Digits from 0-9 are used. These can be combined to represent larger numbers.</p>"},"children":[],"language":{"iso":"dov","glotto_id":"domb1246","glotto_family":null,"iso1":null,"name":"Dombe","autonym":"Zambezi","macroarea":null,"level":"L","development":null,"use":null,"location":"Zimbabwe","area":"Hwange District, Lukosi area.","progress":"\r","typology":null,"writing":null,"description":null,"country_id":"ZW","latitude":"-18.370000","longitude":"26.502000","population":0,"status_id":"6a","status_notes":null,"redirect_to_iso":null},"country":{"id":"ZW","name":"Zimbabwe","name_long":"The Republic of Zimbabwe","population":14829988,"official_language":"English","official_language_iso":"eng","url_wiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe","hidden":0,"autonym":null,"fips":"ZI","iso_a3":"ZWE","continent_id":"AF","iso_num":716,"religion_primary":"Christianity","introduction":"The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South Africa Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its independence but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE the nation's first prime minister has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land redistribution campaign which began in 1997 and intensified after 2000 caused an exodus of white farmers crippled the economy and ushered in widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his reelection. In April 2005 the capital city of Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order ostensibly an urban rationalization program which resulted in the destruction of the homes or businesses of 700000 mostly poor supporters of the opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store shelves empty for months; a period of increasing hyperinflation ensued. General elections held in March 2008 contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the ZANU-PF-led government with the opposition winning a majority of seats in parliament. MDC-T opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the most votes in the presidential polls but not enough to win outright. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008 considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence of violence and intimidation resulted in international condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a power-sharing \\\"government of national unity\\\" in which MUGABE remained president and TSVANGIRAI became prime minister were finally settled in February 2009 although the leaders failed to agree upon many key outstanding governmental issues. MUGABE was reelected president in June 2013 in balloting that was severely flawed and internationally condemned. As a prerequisite to holding the elections Zimbabwe enacted a new constitution by referendum although many provisions in the new constitution have yet to be codified in law.","overview":"Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa known for its dramatic landscape and diverse wildlife much of it within parks reserves and safari areas. On the Zambezi River Victoria Falls make a thundering 108m drop into narrow Batoka Gorge where there’s white-water rafting and bungee-jumping. Downstream are Matusadona and Mana Pools national parks home to hippos rhinos and birdlife.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":40,"land_mass_km":386850,"population_christian":12500000,"population_christian_percentage":87,"population_catholic_percentage":17,"population_protestant_percentage":63,"population_refugee":8959,"population_migration":-116858,"population_year_change":1.48,"population_density_km":38,"population_average_age":19,"population_urban_percentage":38,"population_literacy_percentage":"87.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}}
