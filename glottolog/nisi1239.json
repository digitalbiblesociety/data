They mentioned that they speak\ntheir own language Tagin along with other neighbouring languages like Hindi,\nAssamese, ect.\n\nTagin & Sulung tribes of Arunachal: A sociolinguistic survey, NLCI 2007 says\nthat Tagin and Nisi are two different languages. Nisi language shows 54-60% of\nlexical similarity with T agin.\n\nThe LUAV Questionnaire finding is Tagin is used widely in almost all of the\nimportant domains, and the mother tongue speakers of Tagin have a very good,\npositive attitude toward it. Tagins would like to see their language developed."
