They have been grouped into the same\nofficial nationality (Zhuang) since 1958 by the government (along with speakers\nof ccx, Northern Zhuang,\n\nand Buyang), but previously did not share a common ethnolinguistic identity.\nThere is no central variety or reference dialect for all five either (most\ncommonly some dialect of Chinese is used as lingua franca among speakers of\ndifferent Southern Zhuang langauges)."
