The entry contains the comment that ``The people claim to speak Waimaha\n(Northern Barasano) [bao]''.  The Waimaha [bao] entry indeed has the Upper Tiquié river included in the list of locations. This area has been survey many times and there is no other Tucano language spoken there\n(**hh:e:Jackson:Fish-People**, **hh:es:Giacone:Tucanos**, **hh:hw:Koch-Grunberg:Betoya**)\nexcept Tucano [tuo] and Waimaha [bao] (also known as Bará), and the non-Tucano languages of the hunting-gathering peoples living between the larger rivers also have entries. The Pokangá [pok] entry is spurious, and should be merged with the Waimaha [bao] entry as the information in both already indicates. See also: Tucano [tuo], Waimaha [bao]."
