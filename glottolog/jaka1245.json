      "comment": "E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has an entry Jakati [jat] which is said be to spoken by 29,300 people in Ukraine. The alternative names, which include 'Jat', the classification of the language as Indo-Aryan, and a note indicating 'nomadic' suggests that the denotation is an itinerant population with roots on the Indian subcontinent, i.e.,\n'Gypsy' in loose terminology. 29,300 is a plausible number of Gypsies, or Roma, in Ukraine related to the Roma in countries to the west, but these Roma speak and indentify as a variety of Vlax [rmy]\n(**hh:soct:Barannikov:Ukrainian-Gypsy**:24-44,\n**hh:h:MarushiakovaPopov:Central-Asian-Gypsies**). Thus their speech is already covered by the Vlax [rmy] entry, and, furthermore,\nthey do not call themselves 'Jat' and are not called 'Jat' by others.  Although they could not have reached Ukraine in such numbers as per the E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 entry, several ethnically and linguistically different communities in Afghanistan are called 'Jat'\n(**hh:e:Rao:Jat:1981**, **hh:e:Rao:Ghorbat**, **hh:hld:Rao:Peripatetics-Afghanistan**),\nand the entry may be a confused attempt to render one of them. At least two mother tongues (as opposed to speech registers) are securely attested among the Afghanistan 'Jat':s, both of which are missing from E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26. One may be called Afghanistan Ghorbat\n(**hh:hld:Rao:Peripatetics-Afghanistan**:74-81) and has a Persian grammar and a vocabulary from Persian, manipulated Persian,\nIndo-Aryan and other sources. The second may be called Inku\n(**hh:hld:Rao:Peripatetics-Afghanistan**:82-85) and is a language of the Lahnda group of Indo-Aryan, perhaps closest to E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26's Siraiki\n[skr] (**hh:h:Kieffer:Afghanistan**). Thus, the E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 Jakati [jat]\nentry is either spurious or erroneous (as to location and population) and ambiguous between the two Afghanistani Jat languages. See also: Saraiki [skr], Vlax Romani [rmy]."
