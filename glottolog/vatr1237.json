      "comment": "Vera'a and Lemerig belong historically to two distinct language communities,\neven though Lemerig speakers now have generally adopted Vera'a as their primary\nlanguage. There is low intelligibility between Vera'a and Lemerig.\n\n\"Vatrata\" is not, and never was, used by the local community. It was chosen by\nXIXth-c. missionaries based on another language (Mota). The speakers designate\ntheir village and language as Vera'a (apostrophe = glottal stop). This is also\nthe spelling which I have adopted in my scientific work, and which has been used\nby other scholars ever since. \"Vatrata\" is used by nobody else than Codrington\n(1885). As for \"Vetrat\", it is the name of the place & language, in the dominant\nlanguage of Vanua Lava (Vurës [msn]).\n\nThe dialect names \"Leon, Pak, Sasar\" as listed in the Ethnologue form part of\nthe distinct language called Lemerig.\n\nThere is no body of literature either in or on either of these languages, no\nother reason to keep the 2 languages under a single code.\n\nVera'a should be considered the main language of the two, because it is viable\nand spoken by more speakers (about 300); Lemerig is dying out, with only 2\nspeakers.\n\nImportant note: the three dialects currently mentioned under \"Vatrata\", namely\n\"Leon, Pak (Bek) and Sasar\", correspond in fact to various ancient varieties of\nthe language Lemerig. As far as I know, all these dialects became extinct during\nthe last generation, except for Pak (or more precisely Päk) which still has 2\nspeakers alive. Everybody insist that these three names, all corresponding to\nsmall mountain hamlets now deserted, should be placed under the umbrella term\n\"LEMERIG\" to designate the language.\n\nFinally, Vatrata has no internal dialect."
