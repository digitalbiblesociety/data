      "comment": "This is a case where although there is a high level of intelligibility between\nthe two groups, this can be explained by the historical origins of the two\ngroups. In isolated Palanan town, there was almost nobody for the Paranan\nnon-Negritos and the Pahanan Negritos to talk to except each other, and they\ninteracted for trade and other purposes, to the point that the language of the\nnon-Negritos converged lexically (but not so much so grammatically) with the\nlanguage of the Negritos. Lexicostatistical percentages are skewed by this\nconvergence, and are completely incapable of representing the fact that the\nunderlying stratum of the languages are different, indicating that one does not\noriginate from the other and so one should not be considered a dialect of the\nother. The underlying substrata are a perfect match for the\nobjectively-observable racial differences between the Pahanan Agta speakers (who\nare Black Filipinos, a.k.a. \"Negritos\") and the Paranan speakers (who are not\n\"Negritos\"). Despite their obvious convergence due to isolation of these two\ngroups in the same area for centuries or longer, differences still remain that\nreveal the separate origins of the two groups and their respective languages,\nand the language of the Pahanan Agta in some ways remains closer to the\nlanguages of other neighboring Black Filipino groups (e.g. the Dupaningan Agta\nand the Casiguran Agta) than it does to the Paranan language. Besides the clear\ndifferences in the underlying substrata, the clearly distinct ethnolinguistic\nidentities and the lack of a common body of literature or mutually- recognized\nstandard reinforce the separate listing of these two languages."
