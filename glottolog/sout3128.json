      "comment": "E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has a Southwestern Nisu [nsv] as well as a Southern Nisu [nsd] said to be spoken in the same (or more) locations and with the same dialect names. The map shows S Nisu [nsd] to be spoken in the region described for both (Pu'er subprefecture), whereas SW Nisu is put much further southwest in Xishuangbanna (Dai)\nPrefecture. SW Nisu, as a distinct variety spoken in Pu'er or in Xishuangbanna prefecture, is not taken up in Nisu dialect surveys\n(**hh:soc:Chanetal:Nisu**, **hh:hv:Yang:Nisu**). The SW Nisu entry is therefore probably spurious, or seriously confused. See also: Southern Nisu [nsd]."
