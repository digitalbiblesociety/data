      "comment": "The 1931 Census of Burma report contains an appendix about the “Awa Khami”,\n“Ahraing Khami”, and “Mro”. Clan lists as well as some vocabulary items are\nincluded and make it easier to identify which groups were being referred to.\n\nThe Awa Khami and Ahraing Khami vocabulary items from the 1931 Census are very\nsimilar to each other and match with wordlists collected from the group today\nknown as Mro-Khimi.\n\nThe Mro-Khimi today recognize two broad sub-groupings, Wakung (“downstream”) and\nAreung (“upstream”). The speech variety spoken by the vast majority of people is\nknown as Wakung. ‘Wa’ is a Rakhine/Burmese word meaning “mouth of a stream”.\n‘Kung’ is a Mro-Khimi word also meaning “mouth of a stream’. This “Awa Khami”\nclan lists from the 1931 Census match with the current Wakung clans, making\nidentification clear.\n\nThe Areung sub-group includes multiple speech varieties, including Hrengna and\nXata. This sub- group matches with the Ahraing Khami in the 1931 Census.\n\nThe Wakung and Areung groups consider themselves to belong to one common overall\ngroup, Mro- Khimi, and speak similar speech varieties. Thus, they are grouped\ntogether here under one ISO entry.\n\nRegarding the name for the group, there is currently some disagreement. While\nmost of the group uses the name Mro-Khimi, those living in Buthidaung Township\nuse the name Khimi. The majority group has chosen to include Mro in their name\nto distinguish themselves from the Khumi, who live in Paletwa Township, Chin\nState. However, the group living in Buthidaung Township does not have contact\nwith the Khumi. Instead, they distinguish themselves from the Mru who live\nnearby by not including “Mro” in their name. Both groups agree, however, that\nthey do not want to be called “Chin”.\n\nFor the ISO entry, we have chosen to use the name chosen by the majority with a\nnote about the situation in Buthidaung Township.\n\nIn the 1931 Census, the vocabulary lists of \"Mro\" match with wordlists from the\ngroup today known as Mru (mro), not Mro-Khimi. This group lives in Bangladesh\nand Myanmar and speaks a very divergent speech variety from the Mro-Khimi. They\nare known by a variety of other names including Mrung, Mrusa, Dak, Launghu, and\nTaung “mountain” Mru.\n\nMru (mro) is already represented by a distinct ISO entry, and the current Mro\n(cmr) entry has up until now been used to refer to the Mro-Khimi. Thus, for\nclarity, it would be better to merge the Chin, Khumi Awa (cka) and Chin, Mro\n(cmr) entries and change the name to Mro-Khimi."
