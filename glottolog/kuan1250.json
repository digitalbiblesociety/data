      "comment": "E16/E17/E18/E19/E20/E21/E22/E23/E24/E25/E26 has a Mon-Khmer, Unclassified entry Kuanhua\n[xnh] with alternative name Damai, located in Southwest Yunnan Province, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Jinghong County of China, with the comment that they are ``locally considered part of Khmu'' [kjg]. This entry does not seem to match any language known in the literature, although there are many languages in Yunnan and the entry has too little information to decide this properly. One possibility is that Damai is rendering of\n_tmɔɔi_ 'subgroup' and that Kuan is a rendering of _kwɛɛn_ (an ethnonym)\nthat passed through a Chinese transcription. If the Khmu\n_kwɛɛn_ on the Chinese side of the border were asked are who they are, a plausible response would be\n_tmɔɔi kwɛɛn_\n'the kwɛɛn subgroup'. I owe this ingenious suggestion to Jan-Olof Svantesson (who himself calls it a 'wild guess', p.c.~2011). If the guess is correct, the Kuanhua [xnh] entry is just Khmu [kjg] spoken on the Chinese side of the border. If not,\nKuanhua [xnh] entry should be removed on the grounds of insufficient information to decide if it is the same as an otherwise existing entry. See also: Khmu [kjg]."
