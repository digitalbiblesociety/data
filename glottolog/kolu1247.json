      "comment": "In my 2004 Dogon survey report I wrote: \"According to the elders of the Mombo\nspeaking village Bandiougou, Ampari-kora speakers could understand them, but not\nvice-versa. One explanation might be inherent intelligibility, since\nCalame-Griaule listed both Mombo and Ampari-kora (she called it Ãmbaŋge) as\nsubvarieties of Edyeŋge dõ. However, since the Ampari-kora speakers that the\nelders spoke about came yearly to Bandiougou to observe a rite, this might also\nbe learned comprehension.\"\n\nIn 2009 I analysed the following Dogon wordlists in Wordsurv 6.0.2: Miambo de\nMakou, Mombo de Bandiougou, Mombo Kɔlu Sɔ, Mombo de Kori-Kori, Mombo Pignari,\nNyambaleeŋge de Ficko, Mombo (Blench's Ambaleenge) de Kema, and Ampari de\nPahandaga, Ampari de Pa, Ampari de Danga, Ampari de Baboye. Raw scores between\nMombo varieties range from 71-88%. Raw scores between Ampari varieties range\nfrom 70- 88%. Raw scores between Mombo and Ampari varieties range from 40-53%.\nTotal number of items compared range from 64 to 180.\n\n\"...Mombo and Ampari are separate non-intercomprehensible varieties, which,\nhowever, are genetically much closer to each other than to any other Dogon\nlanguage.\" (correspondence with Prokhorov 12-19-2009)"
