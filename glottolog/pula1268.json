      "comment": "Based on recent linguistic survey findings with research components exploring\nidentity, contact and intelligibility, we recommend that [ypl] should be split\ninto three closely related, but synchronically distinct languages. Speaker\nperceptions and recorded text test scores both point to low intelligibility\nbetween Phola [ypg] and Phala [ypa]*. Undirectional intelligibility from Phala\nto Phola is apparent in middle-aged to elderly speakers, but younger speakers\nwho have had less contact are unable to converse in Phala or Phola and must\nresort to Chinese. Based on the views of in-group and out-group members alike,\nethnic identity and material culture also confirm this distinction.\n\nThe proposed language [ypo], or Alo Phola, is reported by Phola speakers to be\nan unintelligible dialect of Phola spoken in a village in central Yuanjiang\nCounty. The village is surrounded by Dai villages, and Phola speakers say the\nlanguage sounds like a mix of Phola, Chinese and Dai. Speakers from the two\nvarieties reportedly must resort to Chinese in order to communicate."
