      "comment": "The Musi river is the longest in Sumatra, and many speech varieties are spoken\nalong its length. Musi and the other Malay varieties listed in 4a were listed in\nthe 1981 Wurm and Hattori linguistic atlas as being Malay dialects, but were\nincorrectly interpreted in previous Ethnologue editions as distinct languages.\nLanguage surveys completed in 2006-2007 found comprehension between these Malay\ndialects, and a set of shared phonological innovations. The above \"languages\"\nshould be listed as dialects of Musi.\n\nMUSI--language (internal structure) Musi group Palembang group\n\nMusi, Rawas, Pegagan Palembang, Lowland Malay\n\nIt was found that there was high reported comprehension between the speech\nvarieties found along the coastal plain of South Sumatra and those centered\naround the city of Palembang, making a Palembang subgroup. The speech varieties\nof Downstream Lematang, Belide, and Penesak also had a high rate of reported\ncomprehension, and form a Lowland Malay subgroup. The Palembang and the Lowland\nMalay subdialects together form the Palembang Malay subgroup of the Musi\nlanguage. The other subgroup in the Musi language is the Musi subgroup, which is\ncomprised of the Musi, Pegagan, and Rawas dialects. The Musi and Pegagan speech\nvarieties share phonological innovations. Rawas has one of the phonological\ninnovations, as well as some of its own. There is high reported comprehension\nbetween the Musi and Rawas and a high percentage of shared lexical items. The\nculture, phonological innovations, and reported comprehension in the Musi river\nbasin dialect chain provide a reasonable basis for grouping these dialects of\nMalay (as ) as a distinct language. Moreover, the cultural and linguistic\ndifferences, distinct phonological innovations, along with lower reported\ncomprehension between isolects of the Musi language and those of Central Malay\n(Pasemah, Semendo, Enim, etc.) argue against subsuming them all under \"South\nSumatran Malay\"."
