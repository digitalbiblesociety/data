The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902 which occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to administer the combined areas until independence in 1975. A nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in 1997 after claiming some 20000 lives.",

Two German Bible translators Frank and Mirjam Tertel worked with mother tongue translators to complete the Abau New Testament. After fifteen years of hard work the New Testament in the Down River Dialect of Abau was dedicated on May 21, 2015. A celebration was held in the main Abau village of Sinow where the translation was dedicated. The Abau New Testament and the project are credited with improving relations between the Abau and the previously hostile Siawi people. The two tribes used to be enemies, but due to their new common Christian faith many now see each other as brothers. A workshop for church leaders in Papua New Guinea forged deeper relationships between Abau and Siawi believers.",
