After two and a half decades of mostly military rule a freely elected civilian government came to power in 1982. During the 1980s Honduras proved a haven for anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist guerrillas.

Since then the economy has slowly rebounded.","overview":"'Honduras is a Central American country with Caribbean Sea coastlines to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south.
