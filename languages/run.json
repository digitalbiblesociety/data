More than 200000 Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that integrated defense forces and established a new constitution and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The government of President Pierre NKURUNZIZA who was reelected in 2010 and again in a disputed election in 2015 continues to face many political and economic challenges.","overview":"Burundi
