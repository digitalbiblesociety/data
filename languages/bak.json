In the early 17th century a new ROMANOV Dynasty continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific. Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725) hegemony was extended to the Baltic Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th century more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the Revolution of 1905 which resulted in the formation of a parliament and other reforms. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial household. The communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53) strengthened communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. After defeating Germany in World War II as part of an alliance with the US (1939-1945) the USSR expanded its territory and influence in Eastern Europe and emerged as a global power. The USSR was the principal adversary of the US during the Cold War (1947-1991). The Soviet economy and society stagnated in the decades following Stalin’s rule until General Secretary Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize communism but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent republics. ++ Following economic and political turmoil during President Boris YELTSIN's term (1991-99) Russia shifted toward a centralized authoritarian state under the leadership of President Vladimir PUTIN (2000-2008 2012-present) in which the regime seeks to legitimize its rule through managed elections populist appeals a foreign policy focused on enhancing the country's geopolitical influence and commodity-based economic growth. Russia faces a largely subdued rebel movement in Chechnya and some other surrounding regions although violence still occurs throughout the North Caucasus.","overview":"'Russia the world’s largest nation borders European and Asian countries as well as the Pacific and Arctic oceans.

Muslims since the late 18th century, when by the decree of Catherine II the Central Spiritual Board of Muslims of Russia was opened there. In the present post-Soviet period of national revival, there are already over four hundred active mosques in Bashkortostan, and hundreds of new mosques are being opened. The number of Bashkir Christians is quite small. Most of them are Protestant. Despite this, it turned out that quite a few Bashkir people knew about the Injil (New Testament) and were waiting for it impatiently. It took 20 years to complete all the work on the Bashkir NT. When the book was distributed by IBT in 2015, one of the readers wrote to us, “I’m tremendously grateful to your diligent staff and I praise Allah, who sees your valuable work! I have no doubt that the Injil in Bashkir will help quench the spiritual thirst of many people and help them to attain true knowledge of the Creator.” We also received several letters of gratitude from Bashkir Evangelical Christians, who reported of their ministry in one of the regional hospitals in Ufa. Evangelical Christians who minister in this hospital are often asked for literature in Bashkir or Tatar, as people don’t speak Russian well enough, so they are constantly asking IBT for new portions of the Bashkir NT. These NTs are greatly treasured and offered only to those who have a poor command of Russian. The same group of Evangelicals is rapidly developing a Bashkir-oriented ministry in their church.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Cyrl","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"RU","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-1463-7","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"BAKOTP","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2002-18","iso":"bak","title":"Bashkir OT Portion","title_vernacular":"Башкирский ВЗ (неполный)","copyright":"© Bible Society in Russia, 2002-2007, 2010-2012, 2018.","guid":null,"description":"Перевод отдельных книг Ветхого Завета на башкирский язык, осуществленный группой переводчиков и редакторов при поддержке Российского Библейского общества (www.biblia.ru).","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Cyrl","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0}],"resources":[{"iso":"bak","fab_view":null,"type":"Animated Video","cover":null,"title":"The Prophets' Story","title_vernacular":"Пәйгәмбәрҙәр тарихы (на башкирском языке)","description":null,"url_source":null,"url":"http://cdn.createinternational.com.s3.amazonaws.com/non-create_videos/PS/The-Prophets-Story_Bashkir-BAK.mp4","author":"Clarion Creative","organization_id":"create-international","date":null}],"films":[{"iso":"bak","organization_id":"the-jesus-film-project","title":"The Story of Jesus for Children","title_vernacular":null,"description":"In the first century, a group of children meet together to talk about what they've seen and heard about Jesus.
