It is locally known as Anicinabemowin. It is spoken in northwestern Quebec in 9 communities in Abitibi-Temiscamingue, and one community in Ontario. Like other languages in Quebec introduced to Christianity by the Roman Catholic Church, it is written using Roman script instead of the syllabic script used in Cree, Ojibwe and various other Algonquian languages in Canada.",
