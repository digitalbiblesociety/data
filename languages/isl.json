Iceland boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly the Althing established in 930. Independent for over 300 years Iceland was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused widespread famine. Over the next quarter century 20% of the island's population emigrated mostly to Canada and the US. Denmark granted limited home rule in 1874 and complete independence in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined the European Economic Area in 1994 but Iceland was especially hard hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008. Literacy longevity and social cohesion are first rate by world standards.","overview":"Iceland a Nordic island nation is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes geysers hot springs and lava fields. Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital Reykjavik which runs on geothermal power and is home to the National and Saga museums tracing Iceland’s Viking history.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":13,"land_mass_km":100250,"population_christian":274000,"population_christian_percentage":76.8,"population_catholic_percentage":3.9,"population_protestant_percentage":72.9,"population_refugee":916,"population_migration":380,"population_year_change":0.65,"population_density_km":3,"population_average_age":37,"population_urban_percentage":94,"population_literacy_percentage":"100.00","landmass":null,"region_code":10,"region_id":"154","region_name":"Northern

needed, and a committee of translators was convened in the early 1960s. The three synoptic gospels were published in the 1970s, along with the Gospel of John and the Book of Acts. In 1981 the tenth version of the Icelandic Bible was published. The Old Testament was revised, in that ‘Jahve’ was changed to ‘Drottinn’ (Lord), under the leadership of Professor Þórir Kr. Þórðarson (1924-1995). The four gospels and the Book of Acts were published in a new translation, while the Epistles and Revelation were revised by Professor Jón Sveinbjörnsson (b. 1928). The inclusion of the apocryphal books with the Bible had been considered, and their 1931 translation was revised and corrected. For some reason, however, this was postponed, mainly because this translation had too many shortcomings. So the Rev. Árni Bergur Sigurbjörnsson (1941-2005), along with Guðrún Kvaran (b. 1943) and Professor Jón Sveinbjörnsson, who also sat on the committee, completed a new translation of the apocryphal books. This was published in 1994.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ISLINT","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1906","iso":"isl","title":"New Testament (New Translation)","title_vernacular":"Nýja Testamentið (Ný Þýðing)","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ISLLDB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1866","iso":"isl","title":"Icelandic (London) Bible","title_vernacular":"Heilög Ritning Lundúnabiblían","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ISLREK","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1859","iso":"isl","title":"Reykjavik Bible","title_vernacular":"Reykjavíkurbiblía","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[{"iso":"isl","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/1340","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/1340","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isl","fab_view":null,"type":"book","cover":null,"title":"The little book of life","title_vernacular":"Litla lífsbókin","description":null,"url_source":null,"url":"https://resources.lifewords.global/icelandic/67-the-little-book-of-life-icelandic-721303359.html","author":null,"organization_id":"sgm-life-words","date":"2005"}],"films":[{"iso":"isl","organization_id":"the-jesus-film-project","title":"The Story of Jesus for Children","title_vernacular":null,"description":"In the first century, a group of children meet together to talk about what they've seen and heard about Jesus.
