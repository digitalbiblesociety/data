        "introduction": "Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century it gradually added neighboring islands and territories most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949 Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967 a group of military officers seized power establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981 Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late 2009 due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities. Since 2010 Greece has entered three bailout agreements with the European Commission the European Central Bank (ECB) the IMF and with the third the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The Greek Government agreed to its current $96 billion bailout in August 2015 which will conclude in August 2018.",
        "overview": "'Greece is a country in southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas.

Greece is also known for its beaches from the black sands of Santorini to the party resorts of Mykonos.'",

            "description": "The Greek New Testament is the 1881 printing of the Textus Receptus edited by Frederick H. A. Scrivener, a well-respected late nineteenth century scholar.  The Textus Receptus (TR), also called the Received Text, is a printed Greek New Testament that is based on the vast majority of ancient hand-written New Testament manuscripts.  This massive quantity of manuscripts is called the Traditional or Byzantine Text.  The King James Version New Testament was translated from the Received Text.  The TR was first published in 1516.<br><br>This volume is similar to interlinears, in that it compares the Greek and English.  However, it differs with many interlinears in that it does not include a separate “literal” translation.  Interlinears often include a new translation or a so-called “literal” translation.  The implication is that the “literal” translation is more correct than the popular translation (such as the KJV), because it is “literal.”  However, literal does not always mean “literal.”  Most  Greek words can be translated in various ways, so the word chosen by the translator as the literal translation may actually not be the best word in the context.<br><br>Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener (1813 - 1891)) was a New Testament textual critic and a member of the English New Testament Revision Committee which produced the Revised Version of the Bible. He was prebendary of Exeter, and vicar of Hendon.<br><br>Graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 after studying at Southwark, he became a teacher of classics at a number of schools in southern England, and from 1846 to 1856 was headmaster of a school in Falmouth, Cornwall. He was also for 15 years rector of Gerrans, Cornwall.<br><br>Initially making a name for himself editing the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, Scrivener edited several editions of the New Testament and collated the Codex Sinaiticus with the Textus Receptus. For his services to textual criticism and the understanding of biblical manuscripts, he was granted a Civil list pension in 1872. He was an advocate of the Byzantine text (majority text) over more modern manuscripts as a source for Bible translations. He was the first to distinguish the Textus Receptus from the Byzantine text. Scrivener compared the Textus Receptus with the editions of Stephanus (1550), Theodore Beza (1565), and Elzevier (1633) and enumerated all the differences. In addition he identified the differences between the Textus Receptus and editions by Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf. Scrivener doubted the authenticity of texts like Matthew 16:2b–3, Christ's agony at Gethsemane, John 5:3.4, and the Pericope Adulterae.<br><br>In 1874, he became prebendary of Exeter and vicar of Hendon, where he remained for the rest of his life.",

            "description": "The Codex Vaticanus is one of the oldest copies of the Bible, one of the four great uncial codices. The Codex is named after its place of conservation in the Vatican Library, where it has been kept since at least the 15th century. It is written on 759 leaves of vellum in uncial letters and has been dated palaeographically to the 4th century.<br><br>The manuscript became known to Western scholars as a result of correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process. The codex's relationship to the Latin Vulgate was unclear and scholars were initially unaware of its value. This changed in the 19th century when transcriptions of the full codex were completed. It was at that point that scholars realised the text differed significantly from the Textus Receptus.<br><br>Most current scholars consider the Codex Vaticanus to be one of the most important Greek witnesses to the Greek text of the New Testament, followed by the Codex Sinaiticus. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of Sinaiticus, Vaticanus was unrivaled. It was extensively used by Westcott and Hort in their edition of The New Testament in the Original Greek in 1881. The most widely sold editions of the Greek New Testament are largely based on the text of the Codex Vaticanus. Codex Vaticanus \"is rightly considered to be the oldest extant copy of the Bible.\"",

The marginal psalter of the Walters Museum was apparently copied from the same 11th-century model as the Saint Petersburg manuscript, as the iconography of the two is very similar.

            "description": "Sir William Robertson Nicoll (1851 - 1923) was a Scottish Free Church minister, journalist, editor, and man of letters.<br><br>Nicoll was born in Lumsden, Aberdeenshire, the son of a Free Church minister. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and graduated MA at the University of Aberdeen in 1870, and studied for the ministry at the Free Church Divinity Hall there until 1874, when he was ordained minister of the Free Church at Dufftown, Banffshire. Three years later he moved to Kelso, and in 1884 became editor of The Expositor for Hodder & Stoughton, a position he held until his death.<br><br>In 1885 Nicoll was forced to retire from pastoral ministry after an attack of typhoid had badly damaged his lung. In 1886 he moved south to London, which became the base for the rest of his life. With the support of Hodder and Stoughton he founded the British Weekly, a Nonconformist newspaper, which also gained great influence over opinion in the churches in Scotland.<br><br>Nicoll secured many writers of exceptional talent for his paper (including Marcus Dods, J. M. Barrie, Ian Maclaren, Alexander Whyte, Alexander Maclaren, and James Denney), to which he added his own considerable talents as a contributor. He began a highly popular feature, \"Correspondence of Claudius Clear\", which enabled him to share his interests and his reading with his readers. He was also the founding editor of The Bookman from 1891, and acted as chief literary adviser to the publishing firm of Hodder & Stoughton.<br><br>Among his other enterprises were The Expositor's Bible and The Theological Educator. He edited The Expositor's Greek Testament (from 1897), and a series of Contemporary Writers (from 1894), and of Literary Lives (from 1904).",

            "title_vernacular": "Editio Regia",
            "description": "Editio Regia (Royal edition) is the third and the most important edition of the Greek New Testament of Robert Estienne (1503-1559). It is one of the most important representatives of the Textus Receptus, the first generation of printed editions of the Greek New Testament in history. It was named Editio Regia because of the beautiful and elegant Greek font it uses.<br><br>It was edited by Estienne in 1550 at Paris. It is the first Greek Testament that has a critical apparatus. Estienne entered on the margins of the pages variant readings from 15 Greek manuscripts as well as many readings from the Complutensian Polyglot. He designated all these sources by symbols from α' to ιϛ'. The Complutensian Polyglot was signified by α'. The critical collation was the new subject, and although Estienne omitted hundreds of important variants from used witnesses, it was a significant early step towards textual criticism of the New Testament. The oldest manuscript used in this edition was the Codex Bezae, which had been collated for him, \"by friends in Italy\" (secundo exemplar vetustissimum in Italia ab amicis collatum). The majority of these manuscripts are held in the National Library of France to the present day. Estienne made only a few changes in the Erasmian Novum Testamentum: for example, he added verse Luke 17:36, which he took from Codex Bezae.<br><br>The text of the editions of 1546 (first) and 1549 (second) was a composition of the Complutensian and Erasmian texts. The 1550 (third) edition (the Editio Regia proper) approaches more closely to the Erasmian fourth and fifth editions. According to John Mill, the first and second editions differ in 67 places, and the third in 284 places. The third edition became for many scholars, especially in England, the normative text of the Greek New Testament. It maintained this position until 1880. The 1551 (fourth) edition used exactly the same text as the third, without a critical apparatus, but the text is divided into numbered verses for the first time in the history of the printed text of Greek New Testament. It was used for the Geneva Bible.",

Constantinus Tischendorf is perhaps best known for his discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus (one of the oldest extant copies of the New Testament in Greek, circa 360 A.D.) in a monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai. Tischendorf devoted his life to locating the most accurate sources for the compilation of the Greek New Testament. This desire for the earliest, most reliable manuscripts drove him for most of his life. The result of this drive is Tischendorf's Eighth Edition Greek New Testament, completed just two years prior to his death, and considered by many to be his best. ",

            "description": "Codex Aureus Anthimi, or Codex of Berat number 2 (Gregory-Aland no. 1143), is a Byzantine manuscript from the ninth century containing the four gospels. It is written on purple parchment (the color has now been deteriorated into yellowish-green) in Greek minuscule letters, in golden ink, in one column, with 17 lines to the page. The manuscript has four gold miniatures of the four Evangelists, making it a unique surviving piece of its time. The manuscript was copied in an imperial scriptorium in Constantinople or somewhere on the shores of Asia Minor during the period known as the Macedonian Renaissance. The manuscript was present in Berat, south central Albania, from 1356, but there is no record of how it came to that city. It was in Berat during the 19th and 20th centuries. After World War II, when the Communists took over Albania and launched a frenzied campaign against religion, the manuscript was hidden in a secret place at the cathedral church of Berat, together with the sixth-century Codex Beratinus Purpurueus Phi. It was accidentally discovered in 1968, after having almost been destroyed by humidity. Under an agreement with the Academy of Sciences of China (Albania’s main international ally at that time), it was restored at the Institute of Archeology in Beijing during 1971. Since its return from China in January 1972, the manuscript has been housed at the Central State Archive of Albania in Tirana. It is considered a unique treasure that belongs to the whole of humanity. In 2005 Codex Beratinus Purpureus Phi and Codex Aureus Anthimi were inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register. The embossed metal plate covers of the manuscript were produced in 1805 and attached to the body, probably during a restoration at that time. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This Gospel book was probably made in Constantinople in the mid-12th century and is remarkable for the fine execution and monumental quality of its full-page miniatures. The opening for the Gospel of Matthew is missing, but the other three Gospels are prefaced with a pair of miniatures each: the respective Evangelist on the left and a scene from the Gospel story on the right. The combination of Saint John with the Raising of Lazarus is one found only in this manuscript. The text was copied by two scribes with distinctly different hands. One of them must have painted the ornament on folio 175 recto, which contains two falcons, a partridge, and a hare. Falcons were trained to chase game, hunting being a favorite pastime of Byzantine noblemen (the sort of people who would commission a luxury manuscript like this one). Folio 59 verso is a full-page miniature inscribed: “The Baptism.” The Holy Spirit is shown descending over Christ in the form of a dove; two angels wait to receive him when he comes out of the water. The vaguely outlined figure on the lower left is a personification of the River Jordan. Saint Mark is seen on folio 60 recto holding an open book with the text of the beginning of his Gospel. In front of him is a writing desk, probably similar to the ones used by Byzantine scribes. The Annunciation is depicted on folio 102 verso. Mary is in the process of spinning purple thread for the curtain of the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem. The Evangelist Luke appears in a half-page miniature on folio 103 recto. The Raising of Lazarus, a full-page miniature on folio 173 verso, shows Lazarus's sisters, Martha and Mary, very small in comparison to Jesus. The man to the left of Lazarus is holding his nose, because the dead body has begun decomposing. Saint John the Theologian is seen in a full-page miniature on folio 174 recto. Unlike the other Evangelists, Saint John is usually shown in Byzantine art as an elderly man. Here he sits at his writing desk, an oil lamp hanging above. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "Codex Beratinus Purpureus Phi, also known as Codex of Berat number 1 (Gregory-Aland no. 043), is a manuscript that was copied in the sixth century in an imperial scriptorium in Constantinople or somewhere on the shores of Asia Minor during the time of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian the Great (circa 483–565, reigned 527–65). It contains the gospels of Matthew and Mark in their original Greek and is the oldest written document housed at the Central State Archive in Tirana, Albania. The manuscript was present in Berat, south-central Albania, from 1356, but there is no record of how it came to that city. It was in Berat during the 19th and 20th centuries. After World War II, when the Communists took over Albania and launched a frenzied campaign against religion, the manuscript was hidden in a secret place at the cathedral church of Berat, together with Codex Aureus Anthimi. It was accidentally discovered in 1968, after having almost been destroyed by humidity. Under an agreement with the Academy of Sciences of China (Albania’s main international ally at that time), it was restored at the Institute of Archeology in Beijing during 1971. Since its return from China in January 1972, the manuscript has been housed at the Central State Archive of Albania. It is considered a unique treasure that belongs to the whole of humanity. In 2005 Codex Beratinus Purpureus Phi and Codex Aureus Anthimi were inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register. The embossed metal plate covers of the manuscript were produced in 1805 and attached to the body, probably during a restoration at that time. The manuscript is in 190 folios on purple parchment, written in Greek majuscule letters of two columns, with 17 lines to the page. The ink is silver and gold, with gold used only for the nomina sacra (sacred names, often abbreviated in Greek manuscripts). (World Digital Library)",
