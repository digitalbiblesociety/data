During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century it gradually added neighboring islands and territories most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949 Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967 a group of military officers seized power establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981 Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late 2009 due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities. Since 2010 Greece has entered three bailout agreements with the European Commission the European Central Bank (ECB) the IMF and with the third the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). The Greek Government agreed to its current $96 billion bailout in August 2015 which will conclude in August 2018.","overview":"'Greece is a country in southeastern Europe with thousands of islands throughout the Aegean and Ionian seas.

A. Scrivener, a well-respected late nineteenth century scholar.  The Textus Receptus (TR), also called the Received Text, is a printed Greek New Testament that is based on the vast majority of ancient hand-written New Testament manuscripts.  This massive quantity of manuscripts is called the Traditional or Byzantine Text.  The King James Version New Testament was translated from the Received Text.  The TR was first published in 1516.<br><br>This volume is similar to interlinears, in that it compares the Greek and English.  However, it differs with many interlinears in that it does not include a separate “literal” translation.  Interlinears often include a new translation or a so-called “literal” translation.  The implication is that the “literal” translation is more correct than the popular translation (such as the KJV), because it is “literal.”  However, literal does not always mean “literal.”  Most  Greek words can be translated in various ways, so the word chosen by the translator as the literal translation may actually not be the best word in the context.<br><br>Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener (1813 - 1891)) was a New Testament textual critic and a member of the English New Testament Revision Committee which produced the Revised Version of the Bible. He was prebendary of Exeter, and vicar of Hendon.<br><br>Graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 after studying at Southwark, he became a teacher of classics at a number of schools in southern England, and from 1846 to 1856 was headmaster of a school in Falmouth, Cornwall. He was also for 15 years rector of Gerrans, Cornwall.<br><br>Initially making a name for himself editing the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, Scrivener edited several editions of the New Testament and collated the Codex Sinaiticus with the Textus Receptus. For his services to textual criticism and the understanding of biblical manuscripts, he was granted a Civil list pension in 1872. He was an advocate of the Byzantine text (majority text) over more modern manuscripts as a source for Bible translations. He was the first to distinguish the Textus Receptus from the Byzantine text. Scrivener compared the Textus Receptus with the editions of Stephanus (1550), Theodore Beza (1565), and Elzevier (1633) and enumerated all the differences. In addition he identified the differences between the Textus Receptus and editions by Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf. Scrivener doubted the authenticity of texts like Matthew 16:2b–3, Christ's agony at Gethsemane, John 5:3.4, and the Pericope Adulterae.<br><br>In 1874, he became prebendary of Exeter and vicar of Hendon, where he remained for the rest of his life.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Grek","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"GRCSEPT","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1879","iso":"grc","title":"Septuagint Old Testament","title_vernacular":"","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Grek","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"GRCSRE","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1550","iso":"grc","title":"The Royal Greek New Testament","title_vernacular":"Editio Regia","copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":"Editio Regia (Royal edition) is the third and the most important edition of the Greek New Testament of Robert Estienne (1503-1559). It is one of the most important representatives of the Textus Receptus, the first generation of printed editions of the Greek New Testament in history. It was named Editio Regia because of the beautiful and elegant Greek font it uses.<br><br>It was edited by Estienne in 1550 at Paris. It is the first Greek Testament that has a critical apparatus. Estienne entered on the margins of the pages variant readings from 15 Greek manuscripts as well as many readings from the Complutensian Polyglot. He designated all these sources by symbols from α' to ιϛ'. The Complutensian Polyglot was signified by α'. The critical collation was the new subject, and although Estienne omitted hundreds of important variants from used witnesses, it was a significant early step towards textual criticism of the New Testament. The oldest manuscript used in this edition was the Codex Bezae, which had been collated for him, \"by friends in Italy\" (secundo exemplar vetustissimum in Italia ab amicis collatum). The majority of these manuscripts are held in the National Library of France to the present day. Estienne made only a few changes in the Erasmian Novum Testamentum: for example, he added verse Luke 17:36, which he took from Codex Bezae.<br><br>The text of the editions of 1546 (first) and 1549 (second) was a composition of the Complutensian and Erasmian texts. The 1550 (third) edition (the Editio Regia proper) approaches more closely to the Erasmian fourth and fifth editions. According to John Mill, the first and second editions differ in 67 places, and the third in 284 places. The third edition became for many scholars, especially in England, the normative text of the Greek New Testament. It maintained this position until 1880. The 1551 (fourth) edition used exactly the same text as the third, without a critical apparatus, but the text is divided into numbered verses for the first time in the history of the printed text of Greek New Testament. It was used for the Geneva Bible.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":"978-1-5313-1279-4","back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"GRCSTEP","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1550","iso":"grc","title":"Stephanus New Testament","title_vernacular":"","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Grek","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"GRCSWET","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1896","iso":"grc","title":"Swete Old Testament","title_vernacular":"","copyright":"","guid":null,"description":"","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Grek","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"GRCTFP","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1864","iso":"grc","title":"TwoFold Parallel New Testament Green","title_vernacular":"","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Grek","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GR","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"GRCTISH","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1841-1872","iso":"grc","title":"Tischendorf Greek New Testament","title_vernacular":"Η Καινή Διαθήκη","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"The New Testament in Koine Greek, based on Tischendorf's 8th edition.\nConstantinus Tischendorf is perhaps best known for his discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus (one of the oldest extant copies of the New Testament in Greek, circa 360 A.D.) in a monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai.

The opening for the Gospel of Matthew is missing, but the other three Gospels are prefaced with a pair of miniatures each: the respective Evangelist on the left and a scene from the Gospel story on the right. The combination of Saint John with the Raising of Lazarus is one found only in this manuscript. The text was copied by two scribes with distinctly different hands. One of them must have painted the ornament on folio 175 recto, which contains two falcons, a partridge, and a hare. Falcons were trained to chase game, hunting being a favorite pastime of Byzantine noblemen (the sort of people who would commission a luxury manuscript like this one). Folio 59 verso is a full-page miniature inscribed: “The Baptism.” The Holy Spirit is shown descending over Christ in the form of a dove; two angels wait to receive him when he comes out of the water. The vaguely outlined figure on the lower left is a personification of the River Jordan. Saint Mark is seen on folio 60 recto holding an open book with the text of the beginning of his Gospel. In front of him is a writing desk, probably similar to the ones used by Byzantine scribes. The Annunciation is depicted on folio 102 verso. Mary is in the process of spinning purple thread for the curtain of the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem. The Evangelist Luke appears in a half-page miniature on folio 103 recto. The Raising of Lazarus, a full-page miniature on folio 173 verso, shows Lazarus's sisters, Martha and Mary, very small in comparison to Jesus. The man to the left of Lazarus is holding his nose, because the dead body has begun decomposing. Saint John the Theologian is seen in a full-page miniature on folio 174 recto. Unlike the other Evangelists, Saint John is usually shown in Byzantine art as an elderly man. Here he sits at his writing desk, an oil lamp hanging above.
