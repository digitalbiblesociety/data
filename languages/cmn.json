–1734），李安德後來更成為司鐸。從1704年至1707年12月期間，在徐若翰的傾力協助下，白日昇將拉丁文聖經翻譯成中文的文言語體。因此，現代學者稱這譯本為《白徐譯本》。據李安德在日記（拉丁文寫）中的記述，他們計劃譯出整部新約，但由於白日昇的離世，翻譯工作只能停在希伯來書第一章了。 這「白徐譯本」從沒有出版過，而現存抄本主要有三份，都是來自18 世紀，分別存放於羅馬卡薩納特圖書館（Biblioteca Casanatense，簡稱《羅馬抄本》）、英國劍橋大學聖經公會圖書館（《劍橋抄本》）和倫敦大英圖書館（《大英抄本》）。對於這三份抄本之間的關係，一般學者的共識是：《羅馬抄本》是最早期的抄本，其次是《劍橋抄本》，而《大英抄本》則是抄錄自《劍橋抄本》的；有學者甚至認為，《羅馬抄本》是徐約翰本人抄謄的。三份抄本的《使徒行傳》到《希伯來書》部分是很相近的，但福音書部分卻出現有兩個截然不同的版本：《羅馬抄本》是順著四卷福音書的書卷次序翻譯的，但《劍橋抄本》（和《大英抄本》）的福音書部分卻是按耶穌生平次序，以合參形式編成，分為28篇，又稱為「四史攸編耶穌基利斯督福音書之會編」。我們很難斷定這合參本是誰或何時編輯而成的，有認為是徐約翰在白日昇幫助下編纂，也有認為是李安德在白日昇去逝後完成；幾乎可以肯的是這部分不是來自白日昇手筆。 《大英抄本》最初是於1737年被東印度公司的霍德森（John Hodgson，1672–1755）在廣州發現的，他將此抄本複製，並呈獻給當時倫敦皇家學會會長和收藏家史路連爵士（或譯：斯隆；Hans Sloane，1660–1753）。史路連爵士臨終時定意把他的一切收藏（包括這份抄本）一併贈送給大英博物館，之後轉到大英圖書館，所以這份手稿曾被稱為《史路連抄本3599號》（Sloane MS #3599）。1804年，新教的英國倫敦傳道會傳教士馬禮遜（Robert Morrison，1782–1834）被差往中國前夕，得知這份抄本，於是在一名粵籍助手楊善達（Yong Sam-tak，常音譯為容三德）的協助下，謄抄了下來，成為後來翻譯中文聖經的重要參考資料。他們當時不知道這譯本的作者是誰，只知道是天主教傳教士的譯本。馬禮遜和楊善達謄抄的抄本現存於香港大學圖書館。 白日昇譯本是早期較完整的譯本，也是最早的中文聖經譯本。此譯本雖然未被出版，甚少為人所知，對天主教的譯經歷史影響不大，但卻惠及新教早期傳教士馬禮遜（Robert Morrison，1782-1834年）和馬殊曼（Joshua Marshman，1768–1837），對於後來19世紀新教的譯經工作影響深遠。","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hant","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"CMNCCB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1979-2011","iso":"cmn","title":"Revised Bible Modern Translation","title_vernacular":"圣经当代译本修订版","copyright":"© 1979, 2005, 2007, 2011 by Biblica,Inc.®","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CMNCLB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1974","iso":"cmn","title":"Chinese Living Bible","title_vernacular":"当代圣经","copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CMNCOT","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1902","iso":"cmn","title":"Bible in plain Wenli","title_vernacular":"新約全書","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hant","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CMNCSB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2005-2021","iso":"cmn","title":"Chinese Standard Bible","title_vernacular":"中文标准译本","copyright":"© Global Bible Initiative, LLC ","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CMNCSWNT","parent_bible_id":"CMNUNVHW","gbc":null,"date":"1897","iso":"cmn","title":"Chalmers-Schaub Wenli New Testament","title_vernacular":"湛約翰－韶瑪亭文理《新約全書》","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"Digital edition of the Chinese Wenli New Testament (1897) by John Chalmers (1822-1899) and Martin Schaub (1850-1900).

China）。其實，早在中國內地向傳教士開放前，一些傳教士希望《聖經》不單翻譯成文言語體，也望能夠翻譯成淺白易懂的官話形式。所以，倫敦會傳教士麥都思（Walter Henry Medhurst，1796-1857）看到了太平天國這場運動的契機，計劃把《聖經》翻譯成以南京官話口語為主的中文譯本。此外，麥都思可以藉此取代被天平天國採用的1836年郭實臘（Karl Friedrich August Gützlaff，1803-1851）譯本的修訂本。 繼《委辦譯本》完成后，麥都思與施敦力（John Stronach，1810-1888）按照他們的原則，督導一個南京人根據《委辦譯本》新約的文言語體譯成了《南京官話譯本》。此譯本不是創造一種新的官話文學形式，而是引入了某些非常口語化的短語，并作出一些音譯的改變以及運用一些中國成語，使其更加口語化。 《南京官話譯本》是新教第一部官話新約譯本，雖然有人認為其譯文不太準確，但是它被視為開路先鋒，對日後新教的中文聖經翻譯方向有極為深遠的影響。特別是《北京官話譯本》的翻譯過程使用了此譯本進行參照，而《和合本》的翻譯則採用它和其他譯本作為基礎譯本進行比較。1854年，《南京官話譯本》獲得大英聖書公會授權印行了十萬冊。1857年至1884年間，此譯本多次改版重印；內地會也曾經出版過一部用羅馬拼音文字印刷的路加福音版本，只供內地會的教會使用。","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"CMNNPSETS","parent_bible_id":"CMNUNVS","gbc":null,"date":"1996","iso":"cmn","title":"Traditional

Sheffield，1841-1913）接替。  翻譯人員參考了當時幾個重要的譯本，包括《委辦譯本》（《新約》1852年；《舊約》1854年）、裨治文和克陛存所譯版本（1863年）以及高德譯的《新約》。事實上，新約部分的翻譯工作，主要是以《委辦譯本》為基礎加以修訂。 《深文理和合譯本》的「新約」部分於1906年完成，並於次年（1907年）出版，恰逢第三屆「在華新教傳教士大會」。在大會上，傳教士們一致決定把深、淺文理翻譯項目合而為一，作為深文理。隨後，文理舊約委員會成立。除了原來的委員會成員謝衛樓（主席）、羅為霖和惠志道外，還有禮賢會（Rhenish Missionary Society）的葉道勝（Gottlieb I. Genähr，1856-1937）和英國長老會（English Presbyterian Mission）的安飽德（Patrick J. Maclagan，1865-1958）。《深文理和合譯本》於1919年初版，該譯本結合了1907年的深文理《新約》和後來譯成的《舊約》。 當時適逢白話文運動，社會提出廢除舊文學（文言文）、提倡新文學（國語），《官話和合譯本》（1919年）迅速成為國內的標準《聖經》譯本。然而，今天有許多讀者和中文《聖經》翻譯歷史方面的學者，仍然對文理《聖經》（如《深文理和合譯本》）的出版抱有極大的興趣。因此，以全數字化的形式把這些資源呈現出來，供大眾閱讀和使用，具有極大的《聖經》倡導價值。","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Hant","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"CMNUNVS","parent_bible_id":"CMNUNVT","gbc":null,"date":"1919","iso":"cmn","title":"Chinese Union Version","title_vernacular":"和合本","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"The CUV was translated by a panel with members from many different Protestant denominations, using the English Revised Version as a basis and original manuscripts for crosschecking.
