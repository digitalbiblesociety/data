Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then. There have been increasing protests over the belief that the president may try to run for a currently unconstitutional third term in the 2015 presidential elections. Burkina Faso's high population growth and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens.","overview":"Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa. It covers an area of around 274200 square kilometres and is surrounded by six countries: Mali to the north; Niger to the east; Benin to the
