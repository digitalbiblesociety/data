        "introduction": "Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th century the island became a French possession in 1853. It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864. Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998 Noumea Accord which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New Caledonia. The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2018 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.",
        "overview": "'New Caledonia is a French territory comprising dozens of islands in the South Pacific. It''s known for its palm-lined beaches and marine-life-rich lagoon which at 24000-sq.-km is among the world''s largest. A massive barrier reef surrounds the main island Grand Terre a major scuba-diving destination. The capital Nouméa is home to French-influenced restaurants and luxury boutiques selling Parisian fashions.'",

The first complete Bible was published in 1890. The Bible writing system didn't distinguish between the dental (written \"d\", \"t\") and the alveolar/retroflex (\"dr\" and \"tr\") consonants, which for a long time were written indifferently \"d\" and \"t\". In Drehu /θ/ and /ð/ are not dental but interdental consonants. The new writing system was created during the 1970s.",
