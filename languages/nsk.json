For many decades we have had to make do with Scriptures that were translated for indigenous languages that are different from our own: most notably Bishop Horden's Moose Cree New Testament and prayer book, and Rev. W. G. Walton's prayer book.\nThe Naskapi Development Corporation has been engaged with this work since the 1990s, facilitated by Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Canadian Bible Society. The Naskapi community grateful acknowledges the help of all who participated with us in producing these Scriptures. Our prayer is that these Words of God will be cherished by our people for generations to come.The Naskapi text is copyright © Naskapi Development Corporation\nNaskapi Development Corporation\nKawawachikamach, Québec G0G 2Z0 Canada\nNew Testament published by the Canadian Bible Society (CBS) © 2007\nCanadian Bible Society\n10 Carnforth Road, Toronto Ontario M4A 2S4 Canada","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Cans","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[],"films":[]}
