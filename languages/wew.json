        "introduction": "The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century; Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its independence shortly before Japan's surrender but it required four years of sometimes brutal fighting intermittent negotiations and UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty in 1949. A period of sometimes unruly parliamentary democracy ended in 1957 when President SOEKARNO declared martial law and instituted \\\"Guided Democracy.\\\" After an abortive coup in 1965 by alleged communist sympathizers SOEKARNO was gradually eased from power. From 1967 until 1988 President SUHARTO ruled Indonesia with his \\\"New Order\\\" government. After rioting toppled SUHARTO in 1998 free and fair legislative elections took place in 1999. Indonesia is now the world's third most populous democracy the world's largest archipelagic state and the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. Current issues include: alleviating poverty improving education preventing terrorism consolidating democracy after four decades of authoritarianism implementing economic and financial reforms stemming corruption reforming the criminal justice system holding the military and police accountable for human rights violations addressing climate change and controlling infectious diseases particularly those of global and regional importance. In 2005 Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement with armed separatists in Aceh which led to democratic elections in Aceh in December 2006. Indonesia continues to face low intensity armed resistance in Papua by the separatist Free Papua Movement.",
        "overview": "'Indonesia a Southeast Asian nation made up of thousands of volcanic islands is home to hundreds of ethnic groups speaking many different languages.

Zending also made efforts to translate the Bible. The first step in this field was carried out by the zending priest DK Wielenga (1904-1921 in Sumba). DK Wielenga of the Reformed Churches Mission translated a Bible History into Sumbanese . This Sumba language book was published by Scotland who reported the circulation of 1,500 parts in Malay and Chinese on the island of Sumba, during 1934 by their dealer \"Franciscus\".Because such a task was difficult to carry out in addition to other tasks, the Dutch Bible Society sent a linguist named L. Onvlee (in Sumba (1926-1955). In 1961 the New Testament (PB) was in Kambera ( East Sumba ) and in 1961 the New Testament (PB) was in Kambera (East Sumba) In 1970 the Wewewa ( West Sumba ) NT was published by LAI . Before the war only Bible reading books were available.",
