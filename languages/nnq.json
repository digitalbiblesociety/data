One-party rule ended in 1995 with the first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s. Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition led to two contentious elections since 1995 which the ruling party won despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities. The formation of a government of national unity between Zanzibar's two leading parties succeeded in minimizing electoral tension in 2010.","overview":"Tanzania is an East African country known for its vast wilderness areas. They include the plains of Serengeti National Park a safari mecca populated by the “big five” game (elephant lion leopard buffalo rhino) and Kilimanjaro National Park home to Africa’s highest mountain.
