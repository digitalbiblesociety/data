In 1918 the Croats Serbs and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia.

Under UN supervision the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998. The country joined NATO in April 2009 and the EU in July 2013.","overview":"'Croatia is an Eastern European country with a long coastline on the Adriatic Sea.
