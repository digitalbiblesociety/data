The following year the southern portion of neighboring British Cameroon voted to merge with the new country to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. In 1972 a new constitution replaced the federation with a unitary state the United Republic of Cameroon. The country has generally enjoyed stability which has enabled the development of agriculture roads and railways as well as a petroleum industry. Despite slow movement toward democratic reform political power remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.","overview":"Cameroon on the Gulf of Guinea is a Central African country of varied terrain and wildlife. Its inland capital Yaoundé and its biggest city the seaport Douala are transit points to ecotourism sites as well as beach resorts like Kribi – near the Chutes de la Lobé waterfalls which plunge directly into the sea – and Limbe where the Limbe Wildlife Centre houses rescued primates.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":304,"land_mass_km":472710,"population_christian":13390000,"population_christian_percentage":65,"population_catholic_percentage":38.4,"population_protestant_percentage":26.3,"population_refugee":406260,"population_migration":-4800,"population_year_change":2.59,"population_density_km":56,"population_average_age":19,"population_urban_percentage":56,"population_literacy_percentage":"75.00","landmass":null,"region_code":8,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan
