These differences complicated the establishment of a working political community after independence was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100000 lives. The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986 has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. A constitutional referendum in 2005 cancelled a 19-year ban on multi-party politics and lifted presidential term limits.","overview":"Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa whose diverse landscape encompasses the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains and immense Lake Victoria. Its abundant wildlife includes chimpanzees as well as rare birds. Remote Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is a renowned mountain gorilla sanctuary. Murchison Falls National Park in the northwest is known for its 43m-tall waterfall and wildlife such as hippos.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":65,"land_mass_km":199810,"population_christian":29943000,"population_christian_percentage":88.6,"population_catholic_percentage":41.9,"population_protestant_percentage":46.7,"population_refugee":1359464,"population_migration":168694,"population_year_change":3.32,"population_density_km":229,"population_average_age":17,"population_urban_percentage":26,"population_literacy_percentage":"73.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"keo","translation_iso":"keo","dialect_id":null,"name":"Bari Kakwa"},{"source_iso":"keo","translation_iso":"keo","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kakua"},{"source_iso":"keo","translation_iso":"keo","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kakwa"},{"source_iso":"keo","translation_iso":"keo","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kwakwak"}],"bibles":[{"id":"KEOBSU","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1977","iso":"keo","title":"Kakwa 1977 Editions","title_vernacular":"Tomore naludu na Mata lika Kariteni Yesu Kristo ina ku sauma","copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"KEOGEN","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1983","iso":"keo","title":"Kakwa 1983 Edition","title_vernacular":"Wuresi Nakiye ti NÌ³un kine : Biblia : Tomore Na'berona ki Naluduna","copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[{"iso":"keo","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Good News","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/20580","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/20580","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life 1","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/8700","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life 2","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/20441","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82605","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82605","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 2 Mighty Men of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82606","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 3 Victory through GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82608","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 4 Servants of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82607","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 5 On Trial for GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82609","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"keo","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 6 JESUS -
