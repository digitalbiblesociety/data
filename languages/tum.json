After three decades of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country held multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections in 1994 under a provisional constitution that came into full effect the following year. Bakili MULUZI became the first freely elected president of Malawi when he won the presidency in 1994; he won re-election in 1999. President Bingu wa MUTHARIKA elected in 2004 after a failed attempt by the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another term struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and subsequently started his own party the Democratic Progressive Party in 2005. MUTHARIKA was reelected to a second term in 2009. He oversaw some economic improvement in his first term but was accused of economic mismanagement and poor governance in his second term. He died abruptly in 2012 and was succeeded by vice president Joyce BANDA who had earlier started her own party the People's Party. MUTHARIKA's brother Peter MUTHARIKA defeated BANDA in the 2014 election. Population growth increasing pressure on agricultural lands corruption and the scourge of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi.","overview":"Malawi a landlocked country in southeastern Africa is defined by its topography of highlands split by the Great Rift Valley and enormous Lake Malawi. The lake’s southern end falls within Lake Malawi National Park – sheltering diverse wildlife from colorful fish to baboons – and its clear waters are popular for diving and boating. Peninsular Cape Maclear is known for its beach resorts.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":28,"land_mass_km":94280,"population_christian":12538000,"population_christian_percentage":79.9,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":14086,"population_migration":-16053,"population_year_change":2.69,"population_density_km":203,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":18,"population_literacy_percentage":"66.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan

of Malawi and also in the Lundazi district of Zambia. It is also known as Chitumbuka or Citumbuka — the chi- prefix in front of Tumbuka means \"the language of the\", and is understood in this case to mean \"the language of (the Tumbuka people)\". Tumbuka belongs to the same language group (Guthrie Zone N) as Chewa and Sena.\n\nTwo systems of writing Tumbuka are in use: the traditional spelling (used for example in the Chitumbuka version of Wikipedia and in the newspaper Fuko), in which words such as banthu 'people' and chaka 'year' are written with 'b' and 'ch', and the new official spelling (used for example in the Citumbuka dictionary published online by the Centre for Language Studies and in the online Bible), in which the same words are written with 'ŵ' and 'c', e.g. ŵanthu and caka. (The sound 'ŵ' is a closely rounded [w] pronounced with the tongue in the close-i position.) There is some uncertainty over where to write 'r' and where 'l', e.g. cakulya (Dictionary) or cakurya (Bible) 'food'. (In fact [l] and [r] are allophones of the same phoneme.) There is also hesitation between the spellings 'sk' and 'sy' (both miskombe and misyombe ('bamboo') are found in the Citumbuka dictionary).","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[{"iso":"tum","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/1361","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/1361","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82715","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82715","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 2 Mighty Men of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82716","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 3 Victory through GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82717","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 4 Servants of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82718","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 5 On Trial for GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82719","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 6 JESUS - Teacher & Healer","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82720","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 7 JESUS - Lord & Saviour","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82721","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 8 Acts of the HOLY SPIRIT","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82722","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life 1","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/5490","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life 2","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/5491","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/1361","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/1361","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"tum","fab_view":"1","type":"video","cover":null,"title":"KING of GLORY","title_vernacular":"THEMBA la UCHINDAMI","description":null,"url_source":"chiTumbuka","url":"https://rockintl.org/rock-video/tumbuku-themba-la-uchindami-king-of-glory/","author":null,"organization_id":"rock-international","date":null}],"films":[{"iso":"tum","organization_id":"the-jesus-film-project","title":"JESUS","title_vernacular":null,"description":"Jesus constantly surprises and confounds people, from His miraculous birth to His rise from the grave.
