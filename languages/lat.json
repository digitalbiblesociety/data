        "introduction": "Popes in their secular role ruled portions of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the mid 19th century when many of the Papal States were seized by the newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870 the pope's holdings were further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between a series of \\\"prisoner\\\" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by three Lateran Treaties which established the independent state of Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy. In 1984 a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain of the earlier treaty provisions including the primacy of Roman Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the Holy See include religious freedom threats against minority Christian communities in Africa and the Middle East sexual misconduct by clergy international development interreligious dialogue and reconciliation and the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and globalization. About 1.2 billion people worldwide profess Catholicism - the world's largest Christian faith.",

It is decorated with five full-page framed miniatures on gilt ground, the first of which depicts Christ enthroned, with a book in his left hand and blessing with his right. Eight pen-drawn initials mark the beginnings of the argumenta (short versions of the evangelist’s life) in the Gospels of Mark, Luke, and John as well as the passages in all four Gospels concerning the Passion of Christ. The first prologue and each Gospel begin with an initial painted in gold. Scholars ascribe this Gospel to a specific group of lavishly illuminated liturgical manuscripts, which was created during the time of Abbot Isingrim of Ottobeuren (1145−80) in the scriptorium of Ottobeuren Abbey in Bavaria. These precious codices are today scattered in different libraries or privately owned. For stylistic reasons scholars have dated this particular liturgical book to around 1165.

The manuscript contains the 150 psalms with commentaries, as well as additional liturgical songs and a confession of faith. It takes its name from Count Eberhard of Ebersberg (died circa 1041–45), who is said to have donated the psalter to the Benedictine convent of Geisenfeld, which he had founded. The manuscript was commissioned by an unidentified Benedictine monk, who is shown kneeling at the feet of Christ crucified in one of the two miniatures (folio 6r). He is believed to be the former Ebersberg abbot named Reginbald (died 1039), who later became the abbot of Lorsch and finally the bishop of Speyer. The scriptorium from which the manuscript originated is unknown, but the style indicates a convent in southern or eastern Bavaria, possibly Niederaltaich in the time of Abbot Godehard (died 1038). In 1803 the psalter came into the Munich Court Library, predecessor to the Bavarian State Library, where it has remained ever since. (World Digital Library)",

It is decorated with golden display script in capitals, and initials in gold and silver. The main feasts (Christmas, Easter, Whitsun, and the feast of Saint Michael) are emphasized by full-size miniatures. The manuscript also displays four full-page framed miniatures depicting the evangelists in the unusual order of Matthew, Luke, John, and Mark. The precious binding of the manuscript is decorated with an ivory table on both front and back covers. The one on the front cover, depicting a crucifixion, the three women at the grave, and the ascension, was probably made in 11th-century Franconia; its framing ornamental ivories can be dated to the 12th or 13th centuries. Similar ivory plates serve as a frame to the side wings of a consular diptych from Ravenna or Rome on the back cover, which is datable to around 450. The manuscript has been attributed to the monastery dedicated to Saint Michael on Heiligenberg near Heidelberg, which was affiliated with that of Lorsch. (World Digital Library)",

The Gospel book opens with eight pages of canon tables, which are very elaborate. Four full-page pictures of the sitting Evangelists appear as three-dimensional. In the 15th century the work was bound in covers of gold-plated brass. The front cover is dominated by the figure of Madonna on the throne; her head is made from rock crystal. In the corners of the front cover were added medallions with the symbols of the Evangelists engraved below glass. The manuscript belonged to the monastery of Saint Nicholas in Passau and was transferred to Munich in 1803 or 1804. (World Digital Library)",

These works were often personalized for individual patrons and illuminated with miniature paintings depicting the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and individual saints. The text included a calendar of liturgical feast days and a series of prayers to be recited eight times a day, according to established practice. By the early Renaissance period the popularity of the Book of Hours demonstrated the growing interest of the laity in speaking directly with God and the saints, rather than exclusively through the church and the ordained clergy. This manuscript Book of Hours from early 16th century France was written on vellum skin and includes 16 large and 26 small miniature paintings highlighted in gold and painted with rich primary colors. It is embellished with headings and paragraph marks in blue and red ink, and is written in delicate Roman letters of the highest quality. Both the text and the illuminations are ascribed to the Parisian workshop of Geoffroy Tory. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "The so-called Ingolstadt Gospel Book shares the fate of many other liturgical manuscripts, which over time gradually lost their status as religious objects and came to be reused for profane purposes. Only a fraction of the formerly 260−80 folios of this sumptuous manuscript from the middle of the ninth century have survived. Most of its pages were used in bindings of account books in the 17th and 19th centuries. One double leaf was in the possession of the German painter Carl Spitzweg in the 19th century. When and why the Gospel book was disassembled and the circumstances under which it reached Ingolstadt are uncertain. The manuscript was created at Mondsee Abbey in Upper Austria. It is written in uncial script with decorated initials that are slightly unusual for the Mondsee School and which seem to be influenced by the Insular style of illumination (e.g., folio 18a recto). Besides the texts of the Gospels, 10 pages with canon tables are preserved. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This Gospel manuscript, probably the most impressive work of the Reichenau school of illumination, was commissioned by Henry II (973–1024) for Bamberg Cathedral, which he founded in 1007 and dedicated in 1012. A dedicatory poem and a full-page miniature, in which Henry and his wife Cunegunda (also seen as Kunigunde) are crowned by Christ, commemorate the royal donor, who was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1014 and later was canonized. The generously proportioned manuscript, with its wide margins, combines great care in execution with extraordinary artistic power. In the boldly expressive figures with their imperious gestures, Reichenau illumination attains the sublime. For the binding, precious materials were provided by the emperor, who is again named in an inscription. The Crucifixion ivory from the time of Charles the Bald may possibly have come from the back cover of the Codex aureus, a ninth century Gospel written for Charles the Bald and preserved in the monastery of Saint Emmeram. The Byzantine enamels of Christ and the Apostles are pieces of a woman’s or votive crown, which may well have come from the heritage of Holy Roman Emperor Otto III (980–1002), as was the case with many a precious codex. The delicate cloisonné enamels with Evangelists’ symbols in the corners were, like the rest of the gold work, made specifically for the cover. This cover was produced in Regensburg or Bamberg, and not in Reichenau. In 2003 the manuscript was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. (World Digital Library)",

Whether it was brought to Michaelbeuern in the first half of the 11th century (when that monastery was being reestablished from Saint Peter’s in Salzburg) or later cannot be determined with certainty. Besides canon tables and lesser initials, it shows, on double leaves, which are interpolated but which always have formed part of the manuscript, four illustrations of the evangelists facing ornamental initial pages. The evangelists, with their long-winged symbols descending from above, are laid out in bright colors on a pure-gold ground. Only writing stands and utensils complete the compositions, so that attention is concentrated on the relationship between the evangelists and their symbols. (World Digital Library)",

The manuscript, which was apparently much used in the Middle Ages, seems to have been written and decorated in southwest Germany towards the end of the 10th century. It must be considered one of the rare examples of illuminated manuscripts from the Strasburg-Speyer-Worms region. The codex apparently reached the Benedictine monastery of Tegernsee soon after its completion, since it bears additions by known 11th-century scribes from this monastery, such as Froumund.

It includes 91 full-page miniatures, most of which contain gold, in five picture cycles that give an overview of the most important scenes of the Bible, and especially the Old Testament, which is depicted in no fewer than 176 scenes. Among these, several very unusual motifs concerning heroic women are especially noteworthy. The style of the illumination is typical for the transition period between late Romanesque and early Gothic art. With its calendar, the texts of the Psalms, 15 canticles, and ten prayers, this book was intended for the private use and devotion of an important noble lady. Although its English provenance has long been known, it was only recently that the origin of the manuscript could be determined more precisely. In view of the close parallels with another dated calendar of known origin, it now seems probable that the book was commissioned in an Oxford workshop as a present for Margaret de Briouze on the occasion of her marriage to the nobleman Walter de Lacy II in the year 1201. According to an ex libris preserved on the front pastedown, the manuscript must have reached the Bavarian State Library by the 1620s. Dynastic links between the house of Wittelsbach-Straubing-Holland and members of the English aristocracy in the 13th and early 14th centuries could explain the manuscript's migration to continental Europe.

The titles also appear in Hebrew, and there are notes in Arabic in the margins. The manuscript consists of booklets of eight sheets each, on parchment, with the text in three columns of 63–65 lines. Included are the texts of the Old and New Testaments, with a preface, prologues, and commentaries by Saint Jerome, Saint Isidore, and others. Despite its clearly Christian format and content, the Arab influence of the Moorish occupation of Al-Andalus is notable in the ornamentation, and in the double horseshoe arch with a decorative motif in the form of flowers and leaves typical of Islamic art. The symbols of the Evangelists, Saint Luke and Saint John, are included and there are drawings of the prophets Micah, Nahum, and Zechariah, and some initials with birds and fish. Some capital letters and captions appear in blue and red. The manuscript shows some deterioration, particularly in the early pages. Partial Arabic numbering survives from the 15th and 16th centuries, and a complete set from the 18th century. The final pages contain a fragment of a Latin glossary from a different codex. A note on page 375v states that Servando from Seville gave the book to his friend the bishop of Córdoba, who in 988 gave it to the Church of Saint Mary in Seville. It came to the National Library of Spain with other materials from Toledo Cathedral in 1869. (World Digital Library)",

The miniature depicts Bishop Ellenhard in front of the patron saint, Saint Andreas, who is holding the book and presenting it to Christ. The front cover of the Gospel book is decorated with a framed Byzantine ivory. Also included in the work are the preface to the four Gospels by Saint Jerome (died 419 or 420) and letters by Jerome and Eusebius of Caesarea (circa 260−circa 340). The manuscript came from the collegiate church of Saint Andreas in Freising to Munich following the dissolution of the monastery in 1803. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This sumptuous manuscript, known as the Purple Gospel, is written almost entirely in gold and silver on purple-stained parchment. It dates from the first quarter of the ninth century. It contains architectural canon tables and decorated initials in gold and silver at the beginning of the texts of the four gospels and of the prologue to Mark. Four whole-page miniatures of scenes from the New Testament, on folios 24 and 197, were formerly thought to be Ottonian copies (early tenth to early 11th centuries) made from models from late antiquity; most scholars today, however, consider them contemporary with the rest of the manuscript and based on a sixth century exemplar. The manuscript bears monograms at the end of the codex; these were formerly ascribed to the abbot-bishop of Reichenau-Basel, Hatto (806−23). The scholar B. Bischoff, however, interpreted them as \"HANTω EPISCOBVS\", and related them to the holder of the episcopal see of Augsburg of the same name (807−16); this interpretation is today generally accepted. The manuscript was presented to Duke Wilhelm V of Bavaria by Johann Georg Werdenstein in 1587; it was thus part of the earliest collections of the Munich court library, the predecessor of the Bavarian State Library.

It includes in its final 73 pages Interpretationes hebraicorum nominum secundum ordinem alphabeti (Interpretations of Hebrew names in alphabetical order), a list with identification information on the Hebrew names occurring in the Bible. The incunabulum is almost complete (it is missing the first, second, and last pages) and represents the only copy of this edition in Romanian collections. Its rarity is increased by the post-printer decorations made manually on the fourth surviving page, on which the frame and initials are illuminated in three colors and gold. The text is in black, with red and blue capitals at chapter openers, and there are black ink annotations. The print details are given on folio 422 verso at the end of the Bible, before the Hebrew names. Ottaviano Scotto, originally from Monza near Milan, was living in Venice by 1479. He printed books in Latin, including some for the Dominicans, but is best known for the important role he later played in the printing of sheet music. His nephews continued the business after his death in 1498. The Scotto firm became one of the most significant music printers and publishers in Venice. (World Digital Library)",

The text is drawn from such diverse sources as the Bible; the fields of theology, mathematics, and music; and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius, the Areopagite, in the translation by Johannes Scotus Eriugena (circa 800−circa 877). The scholar Bernhard Bischoff attributed the work to the poet and scholar Hartwig, a monk of Saint Emmeram and contemporary of Abbess Uta. The casket for the lectionary was made from gold, enamel, and filigree work, and is contemporary with the codex. It displays a portrait of Christ in majesty and is stylistically related to the portal of Saint Emmeram in Ratisbon (present-day Regensburg), which dates to the middle of the 11th century. The manuscript belonged to the convent of Niedermünster in Ratisbon and came to Munich in 1811. (World Digital Library)",

The carpet pages and the Evangelist portraits are painted on single pages. Each Evangelist is depicted with his symbol—the angel for Matthew, the lion for Mark, the ox for Luke, and the eagle for John—and the dove of the Holy Spirit, a symbol of divine inspiration. From several specific liturgical feast days, which are mentioned in the text and which are particularly emphasized, it can be concluded that the manuscript was originally created in North Germany. According to an inscription on folio 3 verso, this Gospel book had been owned by the abbey of Niederaltaich in southern Bavaria since the late Middle Ages, where its cover was restored in 1601. After the dissolution of the monastery, the book was transferred to Munich in 1803. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "According to its colophon, the psalter presented here was completed by the scribe Balthasar Kramer in the days of Abbot Johannes of Gilt Lingen (abbot from 1482 to 1496) for the Benedictine Abbey of Saint Ulrich and Saint Afra in Augsburg on April 11, 1495. The codex had been commissioned for the daily psalms to be sung in the church choir. The initials and fleuronée ornamentation are today ascribed to Conrad Wagner, a conventual of Saint Ulrich and Afra. In addition, the Augsburg book painter Georg Beck (1450-1512) was involved in the production, in charge, together with his son, of the illuminations. Beck’s son is identified as the painter Leonhard Beck (circa 1480‒1542), who has been repeatedly verified as a miniaturist. Consistent with its intended use in the monastic choral prayer of the Benedictine monks, antiphons or invitatoria, responsories, ferial hymns, and verses are, in their biblical order, interposed in the psalms, thus constituting a so-called psalterium feriatum. The Psalter is preceded by benedictions, absolutions, and a calendar. The text follows the version of the Septuagint, the Greek Bible; only the psalm titles, i.e., the biblical “headlines,” quote mostly the translation of the Psalter iuxta Hebraeos, being a direct translation by Saint Jerome from Hebrew. The manuscript contains, for the purpose of the monastic division of the psalter as well as for highlighted canticles and sequences of hymns, a total of 35 historiated initials with solid colored backgrounds and images from the life of David, who was then regarded as the author of the psalms and to whom many of the headlines relate. The iconographic peculiarities of this manuscript include, in the context of Psalm 52, the drinking fools, who are bowling and playing dice, as well as the depiction of the Good Shepherd, the latter in connection with Psalm 79. The image of the monk and Death, found within the Office of the Dead on leaf 177 recto, is remarkable. The Psalter even uses images from incunabula, including the woodblock print of all saints, taken from Günther Zainer’s Heiligenleben (Life of the saints) and the works of art by Martin Schongauer or Israhel van Meckenem (Judith with the Head of Holofernes, among other works). In the course of the secularization of the monasteries in Bavaria the manuscript was transferred, in January 1807, from Saint Ulrich and Afra in Augsburg to the court and state library in Munich, now the Bavarian State Library.

            "description": "The manuscript presented here, Latin 11947 in the collections of the National Library of France, is known as the Psalter of Saint Germain of Paris. Saint Germain was born in France in circa 496. He became bishop of Paris in 555 and served in that position until his death in 576. The psalter contains the text of the Psalms from a version of the Old Latin Bible. The latter are translations of the Bible into Latin that predate the Vulgate, the authoritative translation made by Saint Jerome (died, 420) late in the fourth century. The manuscript is written in an uncial script, on crimson parchment, in silver ink. In the left margin are 70 letters R written in gold ink. Scholars have determined that the R stands for responsa (responsory), which indicate how the psalms were used in the liturgy. On the initial pages of the manuscript, the monks of Saint-Germain-des-Prés transcribed a text from Jerome’s preface to the book of Job, in which he stated that in ancient times purple parchment was used for luxury manuscripts.

Because the saints are not accompanied by descriptions, only a few of those portrayed can be identified with certainty based on their attributes, such as Saint Catherine holding her wheel and Saint George slaying the dragon. In accordance with tradition, David is displayed with his harp inside the initial at the beginning of the psalter; above him is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, the dove. Gold and silver majuscules on blue or rose ground, decorated with fine white ornament, mark the beginning of each psalm or canticle. A multitude of motifs in red and blue ink drawings are woven into fill patterns at the end of the lines throughout the whole manuscript. Besides a variety of leaf and tendril motifs there are birds, fish, dragons, angel heads, and many other subjects. Over the course of the centuries, this magnificent psalter was housed in several places: it belonged to both the Cistercian monastery of Stams in the Tirol and the Benedictine nunnery in Salzburg before coming to the Bavarian State Library, where it is now preserved.

It contains extraordinary miniatures by the noted German Renaissance painter Berthold Furtmeyr (active 1460–1501). Furtmeyr and his followers were important contributors to the ancient Ratisbon School of Illumination. An artist of great renown, Furtmeyr illuminated many impressive works, including this manuscript, the Furtmeyr Bible, the Salzburg feast missal in five volumes (all now at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany), and many other works. The artist shows his mastery of the difficult task of successfully combining pictures, ornament, and text with great authority. Furtmeyr is famous for his handling of colors, his brightly shining illuminations, and the extreme diligence that marks his craftsmanship. Although he was still deeply rooted in the Middle Ages, his love of color, nocturnal scenes, and female nudes mark a transition to the Renaissance. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This small volume from the Bavarian State Library contains depictions of 12 prophets of the Old Testament: Jeremiah, Moses, Zechariah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Isaiah, David, Amos, Jonah, Micah, Daniel, and Joel. Monumental, with commanding demeanor fitting their functions as seers and admonitors, the prophets appear in wide cloaks flowing amply around them in the drawings, which are crafted in ink with great verve. With spiritual expressions on their faces, they seem to stare at the spectator. Each leaf is signed RAF by the artist Raffaello Schiaminossi (1572–1622), a master of drawing and etching from Sansepolcro in Tuscany. The beautiful red morocco leather binding with gold embossing carries the coat of arms (as a supralibros) of Clement XI (pope 1700–1721), born Giovanni Francesco Albani, the owner of a world famous art collection housed in the Albani Palazzo del Drago alle Quattro Fontane in Rome. The collection was structured according to certain principles derived from Raphael’s theories of art. The binding of this book is much simpler than the well-known Roman bindings from the Albani library and, on closer inspection, the drawings also prove to be copies of engravings by Schiaminossi, crafted by a German artist. The work thus appears to be an ingenious fake, made around 1700, which came into the Bavarian State Library via the art trade in the 19th century. The mystery of the fake has not been solved.

            "description": "The manuscript presented here contains the text of De concordia evangelistarum (The harmony of the Gospels), a Latin treatise by Saint Augustine of Hippo (354–430) composed in the year 400. The manuscript was created in France in the eighth century and is written in a half-uncial script. The Gospels, written by the four evangelists, provide slightly different accounts of the life of Christ, with some events recorded in only one Gospel and others in more than one. Early Christian writers composed works that aimed to harmonize the different accounts and show there were no contradictions between them. Augustine took for granted that the order in which the Gospels appeared in the New Testament was the order in which they were composed, and that the writers of each of the Gospels had knowledge of the ones already written. Matthew was the original account of Jesus’s life on earth, and the writers of the other Gospels either added or reworked content to emphasize different aspects of Christ’s life and the Incarnation. The work is organized in four books: “Authority, number, order, and plan of the Gospels. Response to attacks on the Gospels;” Harmonization of Matthew with the other Gospels, up to the Last Supper;” “Harmonization of Matthew with the other Gospels, beginning with the Last Supper;” and “Passages unique to Mark, Luke, or John.” (World Digital Library)",

Written and illuminated in the 12th century in the Bavarian diocesan town of Passau, it remained in use at least until the 15th century, as it is shown by the exquisite metal binding with a deep relief, displaying the figure of Christ carved in rock crystal, which was executed at that time. The manuscript itself is one of the finest examples of Romanesque illumination from southeast Bavaria; it displays magnificent gold initials with near-naturalistic representations of animals and climbing figures depicted in the tendrils of the initials. Five full-page miniatures with figurative illuminations are directly related to the respective feast days, such as the feast of John the Baptist, the birth of the Virgin, and the feast of Peter and Paul. The picture cycle ends with the magnificent figure of Ecclesia (the church) on her throne, holding a cross and an oil lamp. Two artists participated in the execution of the illuminations. One has been named \"Master of Saint Peter\" after the illumination he executed on folio 32 verso (the crucifixion of Saint Peter). The other artist is usually referred to as \"Master of Ecclesia,\" as he painted the miniature of Ecclesia on folio 39 verso. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This illuminated manuscript, most probably written in the third quarter of the 11th century in the scriptorium of the Benedictine monastery of Tegernsee, comprises the New Testament, but lacks the four Gospels. It includes the prologues and arguments concerning the Pauline epistles, the Pauline epistles themselves, the Acts of the Apostles, the canonical epistles, and the Apocalypse. The text is preceded by a miniature (originally bound between folios seven and eight) depicting the Apostle Paul sitting on a throne in an aedicula (chapel). The two figures standing next to him, each holding a scroll, can be identified as his disciples Timothy and Titus. The groups of figures in the frame sections probably represent the churches to which the Pauline epistles were addressed, because later captions in the margins identify some of these people as Corinthians, Philippians, and Thessalonians. Coloring, conception, and design make this manuscript a typical example of the book production of Tegernsee in the 11th century. The fact that the codex was intensively used in later times is witnessed by supplements dating from the 13th century as well as the replacements for most of the original prologues. The miniature of Paul was partially overpainted in the 15th century. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "The richly illuminated Isabella Psalter contains the text of the Psalms in both Latin and Anglo-Norman. It is likely that the codex was a wedding gift of King Edward II of England (1284–1327) to his wife Isabella of France (1292/96–1358), presented in 1303–8. The initial to Psalm 119 shows a queen, most likely Isabella herself, kneeling between the coats of arms of England and France. Written for the diocese of York, probably in the workshop of the Augustinian priory near Nottingham (as revealed by the calendar), the psalter was illuminated by the workshop of the Tickhill Psalter (preserved in the New York Public Library, Spencer 26). Both psalters are among the most richly illuminated English psalters of the 14th century. The Isabella Psalter features three independent cycles of illumination with scenes from the Old Testament. The first shows views of the Creation. The second is a cycle of the life of King David, with special scenes relevant to a queen, including a wedding and the hiding of the king. A third cycle, in the bas-de-page of the Anglo-Norman version of the psalter, shows scenes and animals of a bestiary, largely based on the Physiologus (a popular medieval bestiary, derived from an earlier Greek source), while the initials of the Anglo-Norman text show coats of arms, mostly of English knights. The Isabella Psalter remained in England up until the 17th century or early 18th century. It was in the library of Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria (1756–1825, king of Bavaria 1806–25) and subsequently became part of the present-day Bavarian State Library. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "Together with two manuscripts in the Vatican Library, this psalter preserves the so-called diacritical Milan recension of the Psalms, which was carried out between the end of the eighth century and the middle of the ninth century. The Psalms, the core of the work, are preceded by a critical foreword on the text and by other introductory matter; biblical canticles and hymns in a typical Milan arrangement are annexed. According to recent research, the present copy was produced as early as the last decades of the ninth century in Milan, where the manuscript remained for at least three centuries. It remains unclear how it came into the ducal art collection in Munich, where it must have arrived by 1580 at the latest; from there it was transferred to the court library. Besides a full-page picture of David as Psalmist, the manuscript is decorated with interlace frames and numerous historiated and figured initials. The stylistic model is Franco-Saxon illumination, here with regional variations. Influences from late antiquity have been noted, particularly in the treatment of the figures.

Its decoration comprises canon tables in the form of arcades painted in red, green, greyish blue, violet, yellow, and ochre, with their architectural frames decorated with floral and geometrical patterns. The portraits of all four of the evangelists, probably executed by two different painters, are preserved. The canon tables and two of the portraits (those of Matthew and John) apparently were modeled after the so-called Ada Gospels, now preserved in the municipal library of Trier (Cod. 22). The other evangelist portraits were based on a different model, which, it has been suggested, must have been similar to the southern English Codex Aureus, which is today kept in the Royal Library of Stockholm (Ms. A. 135). English, in particular southern English, influence also can be seen in the style of most of the larger initials, which accords with the presumed origin of this manuscript in the Mainz–Hersfeld area in the cultural region of Hesse in central Germany. This was one of the main areas of the Anglo-Saxon mission to the continent in the eighth century. Mainz was the archiepiscopal seat of Saint Boniface (circa 680–754), the English-born “Apostle of the Germans” and the first archbishop of Mainz, while the Benedictine monastery of Hersfeld was founded by two of Boniface's disciples.

The manuscript features 292 golden majuscule initials, 30 initials in gold, and five decorated text pages, as well as a full-page initial and a miniature of Christ in Majesty. The 16-line introductory poem on folio 1 verso is written in gold rustic capitals on purple ground. On the opposite page is a depiction of Christ in Majesty: Christ making the sign of blessing sits enthroned within the mandorla, accompanied by the symbols of the Evangelists located in the corners of the frame. The manuscript is assumed by many to have been written in the abbey of Echternach (in present-day Luxembourg), however, its origin remains disputed among scholars. After a period of private ownership, the manuscript was acquired in the 18th century by Provost Franziscus Töpsl for Polling Abbey and was transferred to the Munich court library in 1803.

            "description": "Codex Aureus is one of the most opulent of all surviving English medieval manuscripts. It was produced around the year 750 in the south of England, probably at Canterbury. The manuscript was written on alternate purple and uncolored leaves in uncial script in black, red, white, gold, and silver inks. Two of the four full-page portraits of the Evangelists have survived, made in Anglo-Saxon style with strong Byzantine and Italian elements. The uncial script, arranged on certain pages in patterns known as carmina figurata (figure poems), the miniatures of the Evangelists, and the use of purple parchment all emulate the splendor of imperial manuscripts from late antiquity. Three of the leaves are mutilated; half or the major part of each has been cut away, but without any missing text. The manuscript originally had at least a further five, and probably more, leaves. One endleaf is at the front, added perhaps after medieval times; the back endleaf is missing. According to an Anglo-Saxon inscription from the ninth century, the Codex Aureus was carried off by Vikings during a raid, but about a century later it was restored to Christ Church Cathedral in Canterbury. It is presumed that the codex subsequently remained at Canterbury Cathedral throughout the Middle Ages. Its postmedieval history is unknown until almost the end of the 17th century, when Johan Gabriel Sparwenfeld (1655‒1727), Swedish envoy and distinguished linguist and philologist, bought the manuscript in Madrid in 1690 from the famous library of Gaspar de Haro, seventh Marqués del Carpio (1629‒87). Sparwenfeld donated the Codex Aureus to the Royal Library (National Library of Sweden) in 1705. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This 10th-century manuscript from the Bergendal Collection at the Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies in Toronto is the oldest extant copy of a book of homilies composed by Heiric (Eric) of Auxerre, France, around 865–870. Heiric, a Benedictine theologian and writer, was a monk at the Abbey of Saint-Germain d’Auxerre. He studied under Lupus of Ferrière, John Scotus Erigena, and Haymo of Auxerre. He was the teacher of Remigius of Auxerre and is an important representative of intellectual life in the Carolingian period. The manuscript was written, by at least three scribes, in dark-brown ink in a fine Caroline minuscule script. On the basis of the script, which resembles that of manuscript BAV, Reg. Lat. 215 (in the Vatican Apostolic Library) ascribed to Tours and dated after 877 and the scripts of another manuscript in the Bergendal Collection, also done in Tours circa 1025, it is fairly certain that this codex was prepared in the scriptorium of the Abbey of Saint Martin in Tours circa 950. This scriptorium was founded around 795 by Alcuin of York (735–804). On the basis of marginal notations, it can be concluded that the manuscript likely was once in the possession of the Abbey of Saint Julian in Tours. It later belonged to Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792–1872), an Englishman who was an important book and manuscript collector. For many years the manuscript was virtually unknown, existing as it did in Phillips’s disordered collection. This copy is thus a relatively recent discovery, which is only just becoming known to students of homiliaries in general and of Heiric of Auxerre in particular. (World Digital Library)",

The book features two pen-and-ink-drawn initials, several decorated initials in gold and silver ink, and four full-page miniatures, each showing one of the four Evangelists. The style and coloring of the miniatures follow a Bavarian tradition of book illumination, the so-called Bavarian monastic school. This manuscript, intended for Altomünster Abbey in southern Bavaria, was most likely executed in the workshop of the Benedictine abbey of Weingarten. (World Digital Library)",

This fragment contains the opening pages of Luke (folios 93−94) and John (folios 137−38) that were originally part of Rheims, Bibliothèque Municipale, Ms. 10. The latter is a Gospel book originally owned by the Chapter Library of the Cathedral of Rheims until it was confiscated, along with the rest of the cathedral's manuscripts, during the French Revolution.

Four representations taken from the life of Adam and Eve are followed by scenes from the New Testament, beginning with the Annunciation and with a Majestas domini (Glory of the Lord), surrounded by evangelist symbols at the end. The view of Christ descending to hell in the upper pictorial area and that of the king of hell in chains in the lower picture field are particularly impressive. The paragraphs within the text of the psalter are marked by lavish initials in bright gouache opaque water colors on a golden ground surrounded by a frame. The initial at the beginning of the text of the psalter, the tendrils of which are peopled by human figures, stands out for its complexity and lively details. (World Digital Library)",

Most striking about the manuscript are its illuminations, which include a prefatory cycle, full-page miniatures, and historiated initials. While all are Romanesque in style, they vary greatly in quality and technique, and three or four different artists seem to have been at work. The psalter takes its name from one of the initials, which depicts a young girl in secular dress swinging from the initial \"Q,\" who has \"Claricia\" written around her head. It has been suggested that the image represents a novice artist who signed her work, but there are many other theories, none of which is certain. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "Manuscript psalters are, in many cases, preceded by a calendar section and conclude with the canticles, the litany, and the Office of the Dead. This is also the case with this psalter, which probably was produced in the Magdeburg region. In the calendar, of which the first leaf with the January page is missing, rare medical cures are shown as monthly activities in the spring months: bloodletting in February, a spa treatment in March, a wound treatment in April, a drinking cure in May, and so forth. The calendar pages resembling a diptych include in the tympanum, in the upper left, the signs of the zodiac, and, in the upper-right field the monthly activities. Below in the left column is the calendar text; in the right column are the twelve apostles. The psalter section is initiated by a full-page initial “B” for Beatus vir (Blessed is the man). In the lower arch of the \"B\" King David is shown with the harp; in the upper arch Christ is depicted as the Man of Sorrows. Opposite is an ornamental text page with the beginning of the first psalm in golden capital letters. Additional historiated initials comprising nine or even ten lines appear in each of the divisions of the tenths of the psalter. The illustrations contained therein are complementary to the full-page miniatures on the opposite page, both constituting a cycle of the life of Jesus. On the second of the miniatures, to Psalm 38, the Presentation in the Temple is shown, while the opposing initial depicts the baptism of Jesus. The cycle spans the scourging, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, and Pentecost, up to Maiestas Domini (Christ in Majesty) in Psalm 109, followed by an initial with the Coronation of the Virgin Mary. In the litany are found miniatures of saints. According to a note by Johann Friedrich Hekel on the first leaf, the manuscript originally came from the Bibliotheca Palatina in Heidelberg. Hekel himself, who died in 1700, had purchased it from a rabbi in Frankfurt. The psalter thus seems to have been lost before the Heidelberg library was transferred to Rome in 1622. When and in what way the codex came into the Munich Court Library, the present-day Bavarian State Library, is unknown. (World Digital Library)",

Known as the Carrow Psalter, because of its later use by the nunnery of Carrow near Norwich, it is more accurately described as a psalter-hours, as it contains, among other texts, the Office of the Dead and the Hours of the Virgin. The manuscript is striking for its rich variety of illuminations, including full-page cycles of saints, martyrs, and biblical scenes. It also has historiated initials within the psalter, and heraldry added in the 15th century to undecorated initials in the Hours of the Virgin. Especially notable is the miniature on folio 15 verso portraying the martyrdom of Saint Thomas Becket. After Henry VIII found Becket guilty of treason in 1538, his image was concealed by gluing a page over it rather than destroying it. The image has since been rediscovered. (World Digital Library)",

The manuscript is written in Latin on vellum, and it has a 19th-century binding. Psalters are religious books, especially popular in the Middle Ages, containing the psalms (poems that are sung) from the Bible, often with other devotional texts. Richly decorated, the Psalter includes a fully illuminated page depicting the Tree of Jesse and a miniature of King David, the main author of the psalms. Twelve illuminations, each composed of two panels, depict the months of the year and the signs of the zodiac. Nine sheets have borders ornamented with flowers, birds, and butterflies. The last illumination introduces the text of the Office of the Dead. The manuscript was commissioned by an unknown ecclesiastic whose coat of arms, consisting of azure-colored lion rampant on a silver background, is painted nine times in the volume.

In its canon tables and portraits of the evangelists, it blends the Ottonian style from the tenth century with the traditions of the earlier Carolingian Ada group (late eighth century). The manuscript received its fine binding in the Ottonian period. Its most valuable parts are the two outstanding ivories. The baptism of Christ is represented on the front cover; on the back are shown the Annunciation and the birth of Christ. It is uncertain whether the ivory on the back cover originally belonged to this codex. The Gospel book was originally owned by Bamberg Cathedral, to which it had possibly been presented by Emperor Henry II (reigned 1014−24). The Ada group refers to a set of ivory carvings and a group of about 10 illuminated manuscripts, named after a circa 750 gospel book commissioned by Ada, half-sister of Charlemagne. These works are the earliest examples of the court school of Charlemagne. (World Digital Library)",

Very large illuminated bibles were a typical feature of Romanesque monastic book production, but even within this group, the page-size of the Codex Gigas is noted as exceptional. The manuscript is also known as the Devil's Bible, due to its highly unusual full-page portrait of Satan, and the legend surrounding its creation.<br><br>The manuscript was created in the early 13th century in the Benedictine monastery of Podlažice in Bohemia, now a region in the modern-day Czech Republic. The manuscript contains the complete Vulgate Bible, as well as other popular works, all written in Latin. Between the Old and New Testaments are a selection of other popular medieval reference works: Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews and De bello iudaico, Isidore of Seville's encyclopedia Etymologiae, the chronicle of Cosmas of Prague, and medical works: an early version of the Ars medicinae compilation of treatises, and two books by Constantine the African.<br><br>Eventually finding its way to the imperial library of Rudolf II in Prague, the entire collection was taken as spoils of war by the Swedish in 1648 during the Thirty Years' War, and the manuscript is now preserved at the National Library of Sweden in Stockholm, where it is on display for the general public.",

            "description": "The gospel from the cathedral of Bamberg is one of the most important masterpieces of book painting from the Benedictine abbey on the island of Reichenau in Lake Constance in southern Germany. In the 10th and 11th centuries, this abbey was the site of what was probably Europe’s largest and most influential school of book illumination. Book production reached its artistic peak between around 970 and 1010–1020, a period known as the Ottonian Renaissance (after Otto I, Otto II, and Otto III, German kings and Holy Roman Emperors of the Saxon dynasty who ruled during this time). These richly illustrated codices were in most cases commissioned by high-ranking persons. This manuscript was made for Emperor Henry II (ruled, 1002–1024), the successor of Otto III, who presented it to the Bamberg Cathedral. The gold cover is one of the most beautiful examples of Ottonian book binding. The principal theme of medieval bindings—the Glorification of Christ—is represented by gold work of extraordinary artistry. The cross of triumph, with a large oval agate at its center, dominates the composition. The introductory picture shows Christ, as victor and source of life, in the Tree of Life, surrounded by the symbols of the evangelists. In the lunettes of the evangelists, the symbol of each evangelist is linked with one of the major events of salvation. The iconography of the manuscript, with its rich and unusual array of references, is unique in Reichenau illumination. The illuminated manuscripts from the Ottonian period were inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2003. (World Digital Library)",

The manuscript, written in the monastery of Benediktbeuern, Bavaria, around 1170, features a title piece and three miniatures on books two to four, that is, the full cycle of illuminations. Honorius follows the allegorical interpretation of the marriage of Christ and his Church, depicted in the title piece. In books two to four, the allegorical marriage is followed through four epochs: ante legem (before the law), represented by the daughter of Pharaoh; sub lege (under the law), represented by the daughter of Babylon; sub gratia (under grace), represented by Sunamitis (i.e., the unnamed Shulamite woman to whom Solomon professes his love in the Song of Songs); and sub antichristo (under the anti-Christ), represented by Mandragora. In accordance with Honorius's text, the bride appears in dual form: as Ecclesia (the Church) in the New Jerusalem, and as a personification of the Church remaining in this world, which embodies all mankind. Honorius was a theologian and philosopher who was active in southern Germany in the first third of the 12th century. (World Digital Library)",

It contains 1809 woodcuts produced from 645 blocks. The Nuremberg entrepreneur Sebald Schreyer and his brother-in-law, Sebastian Kammermeister, financed the production of the book. Michael Wolgemut and his son-in-law Wilhelm Pleydenwurff executed the illustrations in around 1490, a time when their workshop was at its artistic peak and the young Albrecht Dürer was just completing his apprenticeship there. The views of towns, some authentic, some invented or copied from older models, are of both artistic and topographical interest. This brilliantly colored copy, owned by Schedel, contains valuable additional matter, such as Erhard Etzlaub's map of the road to Rome. Along with the rest of Schedel's library, the book became part of the library of Johann Jacob Fugger, which in 1571 came into the possession of Duke Albrecht V of Bavaria. (World Digital Library)",

The book is based on letters written to church members in Asia Minor that describe Saint John’s heavenly visions and revelations. It tells the story of the great heavenly warfare between good and evil, Christ’s return to earth, the punishment of the wicked, and the reward of righteousness. This edition of the Apocalypse is a superb example of block book printing. Block books were essentially picture books in which design and text were carved from a plank of wood, inked, and then pressed against paper, leaving an impression of words and image. Block book printing emerged in the 15th century and was used to produce Bible tales and moral stories for a semi-literate population in much the same fashion as stained glass windows in churches depicted stories from the life of Christ and the saints. Block book printing originally was thought to be the precursor to printing with movable type, but more recent research has indicated that these scarce books were created in the same period that Gutenberg introduced printing to Western Europe.

It is an incomplete copy of Pope Gregory the Great’s allegorical exegesis of the Book of Job, part six. The manuscript of nearly 300 pages was written almost entirely by the Anglo-Saxon scribe Peregrinus (“Foreigner”), who tells us in an explanatory colophon (folio 146 verso) both his name and the fact that he worked in the scriptorium at Freising (Bavaria) under Bishop Arbeo, the founder of the cathedral library and bishop of Freising from 764 to 783. Other scribes from Freising contributed passages in early Carolingian minuscule only on a few pages. The front page (folio 1 verso) is decorated with an architectural border, constructed of four arcades that are supported by colored pillars with terraced capitals and bases, as they are commonly used in canon tables. In each of the spaces below the two left arcades an animal looking backwards can be seen. The text begins on leaf 2 recto with a large insular initial \"S\" (for sancti), decorated with interlace and terminating in animal heads. The Freising ex-libris in the upper margin, “Iste liber est sanctae Marie et sancti Corbiniani Frisinge” (This is the book of the holy Mary and of Saint Corbinian, Freising) dates from the 12th century. The book remained in the cathedral library in Freising for more than a millennium before it was transferred to the court library in Munich, the predecessor of the Bavarian State Library, in 1803.

            "title_vernacular": "Pentateuchum Ashburnham",
            "description": "This illustrated manuscript of the Pentateuch in the Latin Vulgate was made in Spain, North Africa, Northern Italy, or Rome in the late sixth century. The manuscript reached Frankish Gaul during the eighth century. It was kept in Tours during the following century, where it remained for about 1,000 years. The manuscript is fragmentary. Originally 208 folios, it contains 129 original folios and 13 folios made in eastern France and added in the ninth century (folios 3‒4, 8, 37‒38, 60‒64, 122, 129) including one Carolingian folio (folio 33). References to gaps in the text were noted in several places on the manuscript in the tenth century. The biblical books preserved are (with significant gaps): Genesis, folio 2 recto‒49 verso (starts with a table of contents); Exodus, folios 51 recto‒90 verso (with a table of chapters under arches, folios 51 recto‒53 recto, the end missing); Leviticus, folio 91 recto‒115 recto; Numbers, folios 115 verso‒141 verso; and Deuteronomy, folio 142 recto. The writing is in uncial script, with marginal additions mixing uncials and half-uncials, sometimes with ligatures. Folio 32 verso is in Carolingian minuscule. The manuscript originally contained 69 full-page paintings, only 18 of which remain; many of them contain multiple narratives. It was stolen in Tours in 1842 by Count Guglielmo Libri, a mathematician, physicist, and Inspector of the Libraries of France, a position he used to purloin many precious books and manuscripts. He sold almost 2,000 of them, including the Pentateuch, to the bibliophile fourth Earl of Ashburnham in 1847. After the death of the earl in 1878, and after lengthy negotiations, the manuscript was acquired by the National Library of France in 1888. (World Digital Library)",

            "title_vernacular": "Benediktbeuern Evangelia",
            "description": "This Gospel book dating from the mid-11th century comprises 16 canon tables, positioned at the beginning after the prologues, nine full-page carpet pages, initial pages, and decorated pages, as well as four portraits of the Evangelists. The carpet pages and the Evangelist portraits are painted on single pages. Each Evangelist is depicted with his symbol—the angel for Matthew, the lion for Mark, the ox for Luke, and the eagle for John—and the dove of the Holy Spirit, a symbol of divine inspiration. From several specific liturgical feast days, which are mentioned in the text and which are particularly emphasized, it can be concluded that the manuscript was originally created in North Germany. According to an inscription on folio 3 verso, this Gospel book had been owned by the abbey of Niederaltaich in southern Bavaria since the late Middle Ages, where its cover was restored in 1601. After the dissolution of the monastery, the book was transferred to Munich in 1803. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "The name commonly given to this work, Biblia pauperum (Paupers' Bible), does not reflect the true importance of this outstanding manuscript, which might be said to contain the summa of the religious knowledge of its time. The work was commissioned, together with another remarkable manuscript of the Rule of Saint Benedict, by Abbot Petrus I of the Benedictine Abbey of Metten in Bavaria and was completed in 1414–15. To carry out his demanding program of manuscript creation, the abbot engaged artists of note, who were well versed in the tradition of Bohemian illumination. The colored line drawings are without equal among contemporary works from southern Germany. Text and drawings blend into a single entity. The many important texts in the manuscript include: the “figured poem” De laudibus sanctae crucis (In honor of the Holy Cross) by Rabanus Maurus (died, 856); the Biblia pauperum itself, the novel pictorial style of which sets it apart from other such works; and the treatise De sacro altaris mysterio (Concerning the sacred mystery of the altar) by Pope Innocent III (died, 1216), with its 43 allegorical figures and circular schemata. The Gospels at the beginning of the manuscript, together with the fine binding into the covers of which relics of saints are incorporated, form a plenary reliquary. The manuscript belongs to the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This manuscript originated in the monastery of Saint Gall in eastern Switzerland in the late-ninth or early tenth century. Because of its typical style of decoration, it has been ascribed to the \"Sintram Group\" of manuscripts, after the scribe and calligrapher Sintram, who was active at Saint Gall in the ninth century and whose handwriting was known and admired in much of Europe. This decoration consists of an impressive script in monumental (square) capitals, the interspaces of which are filled with gold and silver, two-line rustic capitals, and uncial script or monumental capitals in gold at the beginning of texts. The canon tables display rows of arcades, drawn in red ink and decorated with floral and geometrical motifs filled in bright blue, gold and silver. The numerous initials are usually decorated with gold or silver floral or animal motifs or interlace. The miniatures in this manuscript, however, are not typical of the famous Carolingian school of Saint Gall and have been linked to exemplars from the court school of Charles the Bald (823–77). Two of the portraits of the evangelists, those of Mark and John, are preserved and are fine examples of Carolingian painting. (World Digital Library)",
