        "introduction": "The Indus Valley civilization one of the world's oldest flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science art and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century. ++ By the 19th century Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU eventually resulted in Indian independence which was granted in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The neighboring nations have fought three wars since independence the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008 terrorists originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai India's financial capital. Despite pressing problems such as significant overpopulation environmental degradation extensive poverty and widespread corruption economic growth following the launch of economic reforms in 1991 and a massive youthful population are driving India's emergence as a regional and global power.",
        "overview": "India is a vast South Asian country with diverse terrain – from Himalayan peaks to Indian Ocean coastline – and history reaching back 5 millennia. In the north Mughal Empire landmarks include Delhi’s Red Fort complex and massive Jama Masjid mosque plus Agra’s iconic Taj Mahal mausoleum. Pilgrims bathe in the Ganges in Varanasi and Rishikesh is a yoga centre and base for Himalayan trekking.",

F.V.P. Schulze, who has laboured among the Telugus and the Konds for over twenty‐five years as a missionary of the Schleswig‐Holstein Mission.</p>\n<p>The Konds are a Dravidian tribe inhabiting the Eastern Ghauts, speaking different dialects in different districts. Those who speak, with slight variations, the dialect which Mr. Schulze names Kuvi, number about 300,000.\n Having made himself familiar with the speech of the Konds, Mr. Schulze has published a Kuvi Grammar, some Bible stories in the Telugu character, and a little book in English entitled <i>The Religion of the Kuvi‐Konds: their Customs and Folklore</i>. A version of the four Gospels, in Roman character, is his latest work.</p>\n<p>There are very few Konds who can read, and, owing to the repatriation of the German missionaries [during the Great War], it is uncertain what provision will be made for their educational and religious welfare in the near future; but, as Mr. Schulze was eager that the publication of at least one Gospel should be undertaken without delay and has contributed a donation to cover the expense, the Committee of the Bible Society’s Madras Auxiliary have much pleasure in publishing this little book in the hope that it will prove to be of service not only to the Konds themselves but to the many Indian officials of the Government who have been provided with Mr. Schulze’s Grammar in order to acquaint themselves with the dialect of the tribe. An account of the Konds appeared in The Bible in the World for April, 1915.</p>\n\n<b>Digital Edition</b>\n<p>The Gospel of Luke according to St Luke in Kuvi-Kond (except chapter 14) was published by the Madras Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1916, as \"Luka Suvarta\". it was printed at the S.P.C.K. Press at Vepery in Madras. It was the first part of the Bible published in this language. It was digitised in 2021 with the help of MissionAssist, from an original copy at the Bible Society archives in Cambridge, England.</p>",
