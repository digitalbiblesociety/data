Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then. There have been increasing protests over the belief that the president may try to run for a currently unconstitutional third term in the 2015 presidential elections. Burkina Faso's high population growth and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens.","overview":"Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa. It covers an area of around 274200 square kilometres and is surrounded by six countries: Mali to the north; Niger to the east; Benin to the southeast.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":85,"land_mass_km":273600,"population_christian":3746000,"population_christian_percentage":22,"population_catholic_percentage":18,"population_protestant_percentage":4,"population_refugee":25868,"population_migration":-25000,"population_year_change":2.86,"population_density_km":76,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":31,"population_literacy_percentage":"36.00","landmass":null,"region_code":8,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"nuv","translation_iso":"nuv","dialect_id":null,"name":"Nibulu"},{"source_iso":"nuv","translation_iso":"nuv","dialect_id":null,"name":"Nouni"},{"source_iso":"nuv","translation_iso":"nuv","dialect_id":null,"name":"Nounouma"},{"source_iso":"nuv","translation_iso":"nuv","dialect_id":null,"name":"Nuna"},{"source_iso":"nuv","translation_iso":"nuv","dialect_id":null,"name":"Nune"},{"source_iso":"nuv","translation_iso":"nuv","dialect_id":null,"name":"Nunuma"},{"source_iso":"nuv","translation_iso":"nuv","dialect_id":null,"name":"Nuruma"}],"bibles":[],"resources":[],"films":[]}
