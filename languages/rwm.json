These differences complicated the establishment of a working political community after independence was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100000 lives. The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986 has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. A constitutional referendum in 2005 cancelled a 19-year ban on multi-party politics and lifted presidential term limits.","overview":"Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa whose diverse landscape encompasses the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains and immense Lake Victoria. Its abundant wildlife includes chimpanzees as well as rare birds. Remote Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is a renowned mountain gorilla sanctuary. Murchison Falls National Park in the northwest is known for its 43m-tall waterfall and wildlife such as hippos.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":65,"land_mass_km":199810,"population_christian":29943000,"population_christian_percentage":88.6,"population_catholic_percentage":41.9,"population_protestant_percentage":46.7,"population_refugee":1359464,"population_migration":168694,"population_year_change":3.32,"population_density_km":229,"population_average_age":17,"population_urban_percentage":26,"population_literacy_percentage":"73.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Bulebule"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Hamba"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Humu"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kihumu"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Ku-Amba"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kuamba"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Lubulebule"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Lwamba"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Ruwenzori Kibira"},{"source_iso":"rwm","translation_iso":"rwm","dialect_id":null,"name":"Rwamba"}],"bibles":[],"resources":[{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/20831","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/20831","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75450","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75450","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 2 Mighty Men of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75460","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 3 Victory through GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75470","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 4 Servants of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75480","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 5 On Trial for GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75490","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 6 JESUS - Teacher & Healer","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75500","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 7 JESUS - Lord & Saviour","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75510","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 8 Acts of the HOLY SPIRIT","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/75520","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"rwm","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/20831","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/20831","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""}],"films":[{"iso":"rwm","organization_id":"the-jesus-film-project","title":"JESUS","title_vernacular":null,"description":"Jesus constantly surprises and confounds people, from His miraculous birth to His rise from the grave.
