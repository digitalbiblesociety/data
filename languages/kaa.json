Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Bolshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era intensive production of \\\"white gold\\\" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies which have left the land degraded and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since 1991 upon the dissolution of the USSR the country has gradually lessened its dependence on the cotton monoculture by diversifying agricultural production while developing its mineral and petroleum export capacity and increasing its manufacturing base. Uzbekistan’s first president Islom KARIMOV led Uzbekistan for 25 years until his death in August 2016. The political transition to his successor then-Prime Minister Shavkat MIRZIYOYEV was peaceful but sidelined the constitutional process where the chairman of the Senate would have served as the acting president. MIRZIYOYEV who won the presidential election in December 2016 has sought to improve relations with Uzbekistan’s neighbors and proposed wide-ranging economic and judicial reforms.","overview":"'Uzbekistan is a Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic.

hat) live primarily in northwestern Uzbekistan with smaller populations in Turkey, Iran and other central Asian countries.\nThe Karakalpaks emerged as a confederation of tribes at some time in the 15th or 16th centuries. They are genetically highly heterogeneous. During the 1500s, they became virtually independent, although definitely not united. Unfortunately, their independence was short lived. Over the next 200 years, they became subjects of the Dzungarians, the Bukharans, and the Kazaks. The Dzungarians forced them to flee in two directions. One group, the upper Karakalpaks, went up the Syr Darya River to the Ferghana Basin. The second, the lower Karakalpaks, moved closer to the Aral Sea.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":3,"script":"Cyrl","versification":"Default","numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"UZ","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Good News","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/37701","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/37701","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78158","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78158","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 2 Mighty Men of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78159","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 3 Victory through GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78160","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 4 Servants of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78161","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 5 On Trial for GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78162","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 6 JESUS - Teacher & Healer","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78163","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 7 JESUS - Lord & Saviour","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78164","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 8 Acts of the HOLY SPIRIT","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78165","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":null,"title":"The WAY of RIGHTEOUSNESS","title_vernacular":"Ҳақыйқатқа жетелеўши жол","description":null,"url_source":"Karakalpak","url":"https://rockintl.org/rock-audio/the-way-of-righteousness-karakalpak/","author":null,"organization_id":"rock-international","date":null},{"iso":"kaa","fab_view":null,"type":"Animated Video","cover":null,"title":"The Prophets' Story","title_vernacular":"Пайғамбарлар Тарийхы","description":null,"url_source":null,"url":"http://cdn.createinternational.com.s3.amazonaws.com/non-create_videos/PS/The-Prophets-Story_Karakalpak_KAA.mp4","author":"Clarion Creative","organization_id":"create-international","date":null}],"films":[{"iso":"kaa","organization_id":"the-jesus-film-project","title":"The Story of Jesus for Children","title_vernacular":null,"description":"In the first century, a group of children meet together to talk about what they've seen and heard about Jesus.
