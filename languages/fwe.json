        "introduction": "South Africa occupied the German colony of South-West Africa during World War I and administered it as a mandate until after World War II when it annexed the territory. In 1966 the Marxist South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group launched a war of independence for the area that became Namibia but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its administration in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. Namibia has been governed by SWAPO since the country won independence in 1990. Hifikepunye POHAMBA was elected president in November 2004 in a landslide victory replacing Sam NUJOMA who led the country during its first 14 years of self rule. POHAMBA was reelected in November 2009.",
        "overview": "'Namibia a country in southwest Africa is distinguished by the Namib Desert along its Atlantic Ocean coast.

The capital Windhoek and coastal town Swakopmund contain German colonial-era buildings such as Windhoek''s Christuskirche built in 1907. In the north Etosha National Park’s salt pan draws game including rhinos and giraffes.'",
