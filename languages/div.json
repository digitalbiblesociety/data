It became a republic in 1968 three years after independence. President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated the islands' political scene for 30 years elected to six successive terms by single-party referendums. Following political demonstrations in the capital Male in August 2003 the president and his government pledged to embark upon a process of liberalization and democratic reforms including a more representative political system and expanded political freedoms. Progress was sluggish however and many promised reforms were slow to be realized. Nonetheless political parties were legalized in 2005. ++ In June 2008 a constituent assembly - termed the \\\"Special Majlis\\\" - finalized a new constitution which was ratified by the president in August. The first-ever presidential elections under a multi-candidate multi-party system were held in October 2008. GAYOOM was defeated in a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED a political activist who had been jailed several years earlier by the former regime. President NASHEED faced a number of challenges including strengthening democracy and combating poverty and drug abuse. In early February 2012 after several weeks of street protests following his sacking of a top judge NASHEED resigned the presidency and handed over power to Vice President Mohammed WAHEED Hassan Maniku. In mid-2012 a Commission of National Inquiry was set by the government to probe events leading up to NASHEED's resignation. Though the commission found no evidence of a coup the report recommended the need to strengthen the country's democratic institutions to avert similar events in the future and to further investigate alleged police misconduct during the crisis. Maldivian officials have played a prominent role in international climate change discussions (due to the islands' vulnerability to rising sea-level) on the UN Human Rights Council and in other international forums as well as in encouraging regional cooperation especially between India and Pakistan.","overview":"The Maldives is a tropical nation in the Indian Ocean composed of 26 ring-shaped atolls which are made up of more than 1000 coral islands. It’s known for its beaches blue lagoons and extensive reefs. The capital Malé has a busy fish market restaurants and shops on the main road Majeedhee Magu and 17th-century Hukuru Miskiy (also known as Friday Mosque) made of carved white coral.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":5,"land_mass_km":300,"population_christian":300,"population_christian_percentage":0.08,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":null,"population_migration":11370,"population_year_change":1.81,"population_density_km":1802,"population_average_age":30,"population_urban_percentage":35,"population_literacy_percentage":"98.00","landmass":null,"region_code":4,"region_id":"34","region_name":"Southern
