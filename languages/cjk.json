Fighting between the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas SAVIMBI followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections but fighting picked up again in 1993. Up to 1.5 million lives may have been lost - and 4 million people displaced - during the more than a quarter century of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and cemented the MPLA's hold on power. President DOS SANTOS pushed through a new constitution in 2010 and elections held in 2012 saw him installed as president. Angola assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2015-16 term.","overview":"'Angola is a Southern African nation whose varied terrain encompasses tropical Atlantic beaches a labyrinthine system of rivers and Sub-Saharan desert that extends across the border into Namibia. The country''s colonial history is reflected in its Portuguese-influenced cuisine and its landmarks including Fortaleza de São Miguel a fortress built by the Portuguese in 1576 to defend the capital Luanda.'","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":59,"land_mass_km":1246700,"population_christian":17094000,"population_christian_percentage":75,"population_catholic_percentage":50,"population_protestant_percentage":25,"population_refugee":25802,"population_migration":6413,"population_year_change":3.27,"population_density_km":26,"population_average_age":17,"population_urban_percentage":67,"population_literacy_percentage":"70.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Chokwe"},{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Ciokwe"},{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Cokwe"},{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Djok"},{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Imo"},{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Shioko"},{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Tschiokwe"},{"source_iso":"cjk","translation_iso":"cjk","dialect_id":null,"name":"Tshokwe"}],"bibles":[{"id":"CJKCFB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1970","iso":"cjk","title":"Chokwe Bible","title_vernacular":"Mukanda Wa Zambi","copyright":"© Bible Society of Zambia","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"CJKCNT","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1927","iso":"cjk","title":"Chokwe New Testament","title_vernacular":"Usendo Waha Mikanda Ya Masamu","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[{"iso":"cjk","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life 1","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/15560","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"cjk","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life 2","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/82209","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""}],"films":[{"iso":"cjk","organization_id":"the-jesus-film-project","title":"JESUS","title_vernacular":null,"description":"Jesus constantly surprises and confounds people, from His miraculous birth to His rise from the grave.
