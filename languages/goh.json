        "introduction": "As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after Russia) Germany is a key member of the continent's economic political and defense organizations. European power struggles immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious Allied powers of the US UK France and the Soviet Union in 1945. With the advent of the Cold War two German states were formed in 1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself in key western economic and security organizations the EC which became the EU and NATO while the communist GDR was on the front line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since then Germany has expended considerable funds to bring eastern productivity and wages up to western standards. In January 1999 Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European exchange currency the euro.",

            "description": "The Ottheinrich Bible is the earliest surviving illustrated manuscript of the New Testament in the German language. The work was commissioned around 1430 by Ludwig VII, the Bearded, Duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. The text was written, presumably in Ingolstadt, in a monumental script consistent with the highest calligraphic standards. The text was then sent to Regensburg for illumination. Only about one-fifth of the miniatures were completed, however, before work was stopped. Sometime before 1530, the Count Palatine Ottheinrich acquired the Bible and commissioned the artist Mathis Gerung to complete the sequence of miniatures, which previously extended only as far as the Gospel of St. Mark. Gerung finished the work in 1530–31. In all, this magnificently illuminated Bible contains 146 miniatures and 294 ornamented initials on 307 parchment leaves. The manuscript was later taken as war booty from Heidelberg to Munich and then to Gotha, where in the 19th century it was split into eight volumes. The Bavarian State Library acquired three of these volumes in 1950, and the remaining five in 2007. (World Digital Library)",

            "description": "This 11th century manuscript was the prayer book of Leopold III, Margrave of Austria (1073‒1136), who founded the monastery of Klosterneuburg in 1114. Besides a psalter and prayers in Latin, the codex also transmits the so-called Klosterneuburger Gebet (Klosterneuberger prayer), a prayer for the forgiveness of sin in Old High German. Included in the codex are an exchange of letters between Saint Jerome and Pope Saint Damasus I (circa 305‒84; pope from 366 to 384); Jerome’s preface to the book of the Psalms; a commentary on the Psalms by Saint Augustine; the Athanasian Creed; and certain other documents. Leopold was canonized in 1485 and is known as Saint Leopold the Pious. He is the patron saint of Austria. A member of the house of Babenberg, he was born at Gars (present-day Gars am Kamp), near Melk in Lower Austria. The Babenbergs had come to Austria from Bavaria, where the family had risen to prominence in the tenth century, and took possession of the lands along the Danube River between Bavaria and Slovenia. Leopold succeeded his father as margrave of Austria in 1096, when he was 23 years of age. He married Agnes, daughter of Emperor Henry IV and the widow of Frederick of Hohenstaufen, with whom he had 17 children, 11 of whom survived to adulthood. Klosterneuburg is located on the Danube, just north of Vienna. Leopold gave the codex to the monastery with his first donation. He also founded the monasteries of Heiligenkreuz and Kleinmariazell.

            "description": "Otfried, a learned monk of the second half of the ninth century at Weissenburg (present-day Wissembourg) in Alsace and pupil of Rabanus Maurus (circa 780–856), an early abbot of Fulda, introduced the use of end rhyme into Old High German poetry. Between 863 and 871 he produced a metrical version of the Gospels or, rather, a Gospel harmony. His work is a “harmonizing” assemblage of selected texts from all four Gospels that tells the story of the life of Christ in southern Rhine Franconian dialect. It is divided in five books with a prologue and is thus a counterpart to the Old Saxon Heliand (an epic poem written down in the early to mid-ninth century that recounts the life of Jesus). The manuscript presented here, consisting of 125 parchment leaves, was copied in 902‒5 in Freising by order of Bishop Waldo of Freising (in office circa 884‒circa 906) from a codex borrowed from Weissenburg. It shows the transition from Carolingian minuscule to the 10th-century script. The first half of each line is in the left-hand column, the second half in the right-hand column, and the odd-numbered lines begin with red initials. In 1803, when Freising Cathedral Library was secularized, the manuscript was untraceable. It took another year to detect it in the cathedral archives, from where it was transferred to the Munich Court Library, predecessor of today’s Bavarian State Library. (World Digital Library)",
