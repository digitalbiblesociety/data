        "introduction": "The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.",
        "overview": "The United Kingdom made up of England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland is an island nation in northwestern Europe. England – birthplace of Shakespeare and The Beatles – is home to the capital London a globally influential centre of finance and culture. England is also site of Neolithic Stonehenge Bath’s Roman spa and centuries-old universities at Oxford and Cambridge.",

The original capital letters, many of which are pictorial, have been restored to each chapter in order to replicate the visual appeal of the early editions.<br>The 1611 text is followed page-for-page and line-for-line, and all misprints are reproduced rather than corrected. The large body of preliminary matter, which includes genealogies, maps, and lists of readings, is also included. The text of the 1611 edition differs from modern editions of the King James Version in thousands of details, and this edition is the most authentic version of the original text that has ever been published.",

            "description": "This rare translation was first published in Philadelphia in two volumes, the Gospels in 1822, and Acts-Revelation in 1823. This first two-volume edition contains both the Greek text and Kneeland’s own translation on each page. In his preface, he claims that he is the first to publish “a Greek and English testament.” The Greek text is that of Griesbach, which, according to Kneeland, was in his day “the most correct Greek text, as acknowledged by all.” A one-volume edition of the English translation alone appeared in 1823. Kneeland lived from 1774-1844.<br><br>Reflecting the scholarship of the time, frequent references are made throughout the notes to the translations of George Campbell, Wakefield, Scarlett, MacKnight, Charles Thomson, and the 1808 Improved Version. Parkhurst’s Greek lexicon is also referenced regularly.<br><br>Kneeland himself was a story of continually developing liberalism. In 1803 he became a Universalist after spending a few years as a Baptist preacher. He stayed a Universalist for 26 years. It was during this period that his friend, Hosea Ballou, helped allay his doubts about the inspiration of Scripture, leading to his producing this translation. In 1829, he left the Universalists, moved to Boston, and founded a group of freethinkers. Here he enjoyed the friendship of men such as William Ellery Channing, Ralph Walso Emerson, Theodore Parker, and William Lloyd Garrison. In 1834 he was tried and convicted for blashphemy. After 4 years of appeals and litigation, he served 60 days. Simms says his trial and conviction were “utter absurdities, growing out of the narrowness of the day.” In 1839, hoping to found a freethinker colony, he moved to Iowa where he died in 1844. Throughout his life, he was an avid writer and publisher. (Society of Bible Collectors)",

In 1710, Whitby challenged the critical works of John Mill and defended Textus Receptus against thirty thousand textual variants in Mill's edition of the New Testament. Of this Examen variantium Lectionum Johannis Milli use was made by Anthony Collins; it was reprinted (Leyden, 1724) by Sigebert Haverkamp.",

Hanson is cited as a primary source in the 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, and New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge (1908–14) articles on Universalism. Hanson and Knight's reading of church history has been challenged, but has also found defenders, such as Ilaria Ramelli.",

However, he soon regretted being ordained because he soon found himself unable to subscribe to the Anglican articles of faith. He taught at various schools which held Unitarian views. Politically, he was very outspoken; teaching that all war was immoral and the prevailing forms of government, both civil and ecclesiastical, were a “bond of iniquity.” The first edition of his New Testament was published in 1791 with a revised edition in 1795 and a third edition in 1820.",

            "description": "The Pictorial Bible Being the Old and New Testaments according to the Authorised version, illustrated with many hundred woodcuts representing the historical events, after celebrated pictures; the landscape scenes from original drawings or from authentic engravings; and the subjects of natural history, costume and antiquities from the best sources. To which are added original notes chiefly explanatory of the engravings and of such passages connected with the history geography, natural history, antiquities of the sacred scriptures as require observation.<br><br>Charles Knight seems to have published several versions and offshoots of this edition. The Western Antiquary mentionsOffsite Link a 4-volume version published in 1838-1839. Between 1847 and 1849 Knight published in 4 volumes a \"new edition\" in which \"the notes are much augmented, and completely revised.\"Offsite Link In this edition John Kitto was credited as editor and writer of the notes. For this edition the text was reset into two columns.  In 1855-56 W & R Chambers issued a new edition in London, 1855-56. The work was revised by T. R. Birks and published in London by James Sangster 1871-76, having been published in 56 parts. Kitto's notes and commentaries on the Bible texts were so extensive that in 1840 Knight issued the notes and commentary without the Bible text in 5 large 8vo volumes containing well over 1000 pages as The Illustrated Commentary on the Old and New Testament...being a republication of the notes of the Pictorial Bible (5 vols.).<br><br>\"Charles Knight's publication of the lavishly illustrated Pictorial Bible (1836-380 transformed the established format of illustrated Bibles. The project was driven by a desire for popular education and reflected Knight's wider editorial concerns, evident in the Penny Magazine and his involvement with the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. During the 1830s the typical illustrated Bible contained on average thirty illustrations. Their selection followed a pattern that had been established i the 1790s and included engravings after works by canonical masters such as Raphael, Rose, Reni, Domenichino, the Carracci, Rubens and Pousin. While in Knight's Pictorial Bible the selection of illustrations showing biblical events remained virtually unchanged, the volumes were teeming with completely new types of illsutration, which were broadly speaking scientific and historical. They showed the fauna and flora, architecture, customs and dresses and the landscapes of the Bible. The Pictorial Bible was intended to 'make the ojbects described or referred to in the Holy Scriptures familiar to the eye of the general reader\" (Giebelhausen, Painting the Bible: Representation and Belief in Mid-Victorian Britain [2006] 135).",

Rotherham was a Bible scholar and minister of the Churches of Christ, who described his goal as \"placing the reader of the present time in as good a position as that occupied by the reader of the first century for understanding the Apostolic Writings\".",

Stamford & London: for the author, 1745. <br><br>\"Printed for the Author, and Sold by the Booksellers of London and Westminster. M.DCC.XLV. According to the Greek of the Clermont Manuscript, now probably between 1400 and 1500 Years old, in the King of France's Library at Paris: According to the Collation in Dr. Mill's New Testament: the Latin of which Copy is Part of the Old Italick Version, made early in the Second Century.\"\"<br><br>This work follows the KJV except where Greek manuscripts dictate a difference in wording, or addition, or omission. Whiston published his Primitive New Testament on the basis of Codex Bezae and Codex Claromontanus.<br><br>William Whiston founded a society for promoting primitive Christianity, lecturing in support of his theories in halls and coffee-houses at London, Bath, and Tunbridge Wells. Those he involved included Thomas Chubb, Thomas Emlyn, John Gale, Benjamin Hoadley, Arthur Onslow, and Thomas Rundle. There were meetings at Whiston's house from 1715 to 1717; Hoadley avoided coming, as did Samuel Clarke, though invited. A meeting with Clarke, Hoadley, John Craig and Gilbert Burnet the younger had left these leading latitudinarians unconvinced about Whiston's reliance on the Apostolical Constitutions.<br><br>Franz Wokenius wrote a 1728 Latin work on Whiston's view of primitive Christianity. His challenge to the teachings of Athanasius meant that Whiston was commonly considered heretical on many points. On the other hand, he was a firm believer in supernatural aspects of Christianity. He defended prophecy and miracle. He supported anointing the sick and touching for the king's evil. His dislike of rationalism in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents of Hoadley's Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament. He was fervent in his views of ecclesiastical government and discipline, derived from the Apostolical Constitutions.<br><br>About 1747 Whiston finally left the Anglican communion for the Baptists. He quit the church literally as well as figuratively, as the clergyman began to read the Athanasian Creed.  (Wikipedia)",

The Great Bible was prepared by Myles Coverdale, working under commission of Thomas, Lord Cromwell, Secretary to Henry VIII and Vicar General. In 1538, Cromwell directed the clergy to provide \"one book of the Bible of the largest volume in English, and the same set up in some convenient place within the said church that ye have care of, whereas your parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same and read it.\"<br><br>The Great Bible includes much from the Tyndale Bible, with the objectionable features revised. As the Tyndale Bible was incomplete, Coverdale translated the remaining books of the Old Testament and Apocrypha from the Latin Vulgate and German translations, rather than working from the original Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Although called the Great Bible because of its large size, it is known by several other names as well: the Cromwell Bible, since Thomas Cromwell directed its publication; Whitchurch's Bible after its first English printer; the Chained Bible, since it was chained to prevent removal from the church. It has less accurately been termed Cranmer's Bible, since although Thomas Cranmer was not responsible for the translation, a preface by him appeared in the second edition.<br><br>\"The Byble in Englyſhe, that is to ſaye the content of all the holy ſcrypture, bothe of yͤ olde and newe teſtament, truly tranſlated after the veryte of the Hebrue and Greke textes, by yͤ Dylygent ſtudye of dyuerſe excellent learned men, expert in the forſayde tonges.\" (Wikipedia)",

In 1906 he left Scranton to take a position as rector at St. James Church in Perkiomen, Pennsylvania (now Evansburg). His habits and his teaching while at St. James have been described as unorthodox.  Many in his congregation requested that he be removed, and in 1914 he was removed by the bishop of the diocese. He refused to leave his position, however, and was finally compelled to vacate the rectory by a secular court order. Afterwards he held no ministerial position, and began to publish books expressing radical ideas about the interpretation of the Bible, and advocating the metaphysical teachings of Mary Baker Eddy (founder of Christian Science), under the pen-name of Craig MacCameline.

            "description": "The New Testament, in an Improved Version, upon the Basis of Archbishop Newcome’s New Translation: with a Corrected Text, and Notes Critical and Explanatory. London: Richard Taylor & Co., 1808. An American edition was distributed by William Wells of Boston in 1809. A fourth London edition “with corrections and additions” was printed by Richard and Arthur Taylor in 1817.<br><br>This “Improved” version of the New Testament was a revision of Newcome’s version (1796), and was published anonymously, by what the title page called “A Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue by the Distribution of Books.” The publisher’s use of the phrase “Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge” was apparently designed to give people the impression that the version was published by the well-known Anglican organization of that name founded by Thomas Bray in 1698, whose mission was to make inexpensive editions of uncontroversial, orthodox Christian books available to poor churches abroad. The Introduction neglects to mention the fact that the “Society” referred to on the title page was actually the Unitarian Society, and that the sole purpose of the version was to promote Unitarian ideas. The concealment of its true purpose was deliberate, as its principal editor later explained: “the editors … thought it needless to insert the word Unitarian in the title page, which would deter some ignorant and prejudiced people from looking into a work from which they might otherwise derive instruction.” 1 It soon became known, however, that the version was financed by the Unitarians and done mainly by Thomas Belsham, a notorious Unitarian controversialist.

            "description": "The purpose of the EasyEnglish Bible is to make the Bible as clear as possible in simple English. We have used a basic vocabulary of 1200 well-known English words. It is a very good Bible for anyone who is learning English or speaks English as a foreign language.  EasyEnglish Website: To help you even more, the EasyEnglish Bible website – www.easyenglish.bible – has Commentaries and Bible Studies to help you understand the message of the Bible and apply it to your life.  Translation Principles: To make the Bible as easy as possible to understand, we have used: Short sentences, Short paragraphs, Simple grammar. We have avoided things that can be hard to understand, so we have used: No passive verbs, No idioms, No split infinitives, No rhetorical questions. The EasyEnglish Bible is a “meaning-for-meaning” translation not a “word-for-word” translation.  It expresses the meaning of the original message in the most clear, accurate and natural way possible in simple English. It changes the order of words if that makes the meaning clearer in English. It translates the meaning of idioms rather than the literal words. It uses British spelling, grammar and punctuation. These translation principles have been developed by Wycliffe Bible Translators (WBT) and SIL.  EasyEnglish Translation Team: The EasyEnglish Bible has been translated by MissionAssist, which is a Christian charity based in the United Kingdom. MissionAssist is part of the Wycliffe Global Alliance (WGA) and a member of Global Connections.  The EasyEnglish Bible translation team includes:  Linguistic Checkers - People who check the linguistic consistency of the work. Our linguistic checkers normally have a degree in Linguistics or English (or similar) and a TEFL qualification. Theological Checkers - People who check the theological accuracy of the work. Our theological checkers have a degree in theology (or a similar qualification). Style Checkers - People who check drafts and final output for accuracy, consistency and conformance to EasyEnglish principles. The Base Text We have used a range of English Bible translations as a base. Where English versions have a different understanding of the original text, we have referred to the Hebrew or Greek text, using the texts published and updated by United Bible Societies (UBS):  Old Testament: Biblia Hebraica “Masoretic Text” New Testament: The Nestle-Aland “Novum Testamentum Graece” We also use the resources provided by Wycliffe Bible Translators to help translators and checkers understand the issues involved in translating the original texts.

Nevertheless, later in life, he became the chief conservative Unitarian opponent of Transcendentalism. As a vocal and well-published theologian, he earned from some the joking title of \"the Unitarian Pope\".<br><br>He was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, son of Samuel Norton. Norton graduated from Harvard University in 1804 and continued as a graduate student and lecturer there and at Bowdoin College. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1815. He was named Dexter Lecturer on Biblical Criticism in 1813, and in 1819, Harvard made him the first Dexter Professor of Sacred Literature, a position he held until 1830; he also served as Harvard College Librarian from 1813 to 1821.<br><br>He opposed himself to the rise of Transcendentalism and insisted on the truth of some of the Biblical miracles, while rejecting \"most of those in the Old Testament, and a few in the new\", including rejecting the virgin birth.",

            "title_vernacular": null,
            "description": "The Matthew Bible, also known as Matthew's Version, was first published in 1537 by John Rogers, under the pseudonym \"Thomas Matthew\". It combined the New Testament of William Tyndale, and as much of the Old Testament as he had been able to translate before being captured and put to death. Myles Coverdale's translations, chiefly from German and Latin sources, completed the Old Testament and Biblical apocrypha, except for the Prayer of Manasseh, which was Rogers'. It is thus a vital link in the main sequence of English Bible translations.<br><br>Matthew's Bible was the combined work of three individuals, working from numerous sources in at least five different languages.<br><br>The entire New Testament (first published in 1526, later revised, 1534 and 1535), the Pentateuch, Jonah and in David Daniell's view, the Book of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, First and Second Samuel, First and Second Kings, and First and Second Chronicles, were the work of William Tyndale. Tyndale worked directly from the Hebrew and Greek, occasionally consulting the Vulgate and Erasmus’s Latin version, and he used Luther's Bible for the prefaces, marginal notes and the biblical text. The use of the pseudonym \"Thomas Matthew\" resulted possibly from the need to conceal from Henry VIII the participation of Tyndale in the translation. A theory exists that indicates the name Thomas Matthew, which in Greek means \"A twin to the original gift from God\", may have been chosen to indicate that the largest contributing author was indeed William Tyndale and that his writings were preserved.<br><br>The remaining books of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha were the work of Myles Coverdale. Coverdale translated primarily from German and Latin sources. Historians often tend to treat Coverdale and Tyndale like competitors in a race to complete the monumental and arduous task of translating the biblical text. One is often credited to the exclusion of the other. In reality they knew each other and occasionally worked together. Contemporary historian John Foxe states that they were in Hamburg translating the Pentateuch together as early as 1529.<br><br>The Prayer of Manasseh was the work of John Rogers. Rogers translated from a French Bible printed two years earlier (in 1535). Rogers compiled the completed work and added the preface, some marginal notes, a calendar and an almanac.<br><br>Of the three translators, two were burned at the stake. Tyndale was burned on 6 October 1536 in Vilvoorde, Belgium. John Rogers was \"tested by fire\" on 4 February 1555 at Smithfield, England; the first to meet this fate under Mary I of England. Myles Coverdale was employed by Cromwell to work on the Great Bible of 1539, the first officially authorized English translation of the Bible.<br><br>Time and extensive scholastic scrutiny have judged Tyndale the most gifted of the three translators. Dr. Westcott (in his History of the English Bible) states that \"The history of our English Bible begins with the work of Tyndale and not with that of Wycliffe.\" The quality of his translations has also stood the test of time, coming relatively intact even into modern versions of the Bible. A. S. Herbert, Bible cataloguer, says of the Matthew Bible, \"this version, which welds together the best work of Tyndale and Coverdale, is generally considered to be the real primary version of our English Bible\", upon which later editions were based, including the Geneva Bible and King James Version. Professor David Daniell recounts that, \"New Testament scholars Jon Nielson and Royal Skousen observed that previous estimates of Tyndale's contribution to the KJV 'have run from a high of up to 90% (Westcott) to a low of 18% (Butterworth)'. By a statistically accurate and appropriate method of sampling, based on eighteen portions of the Bible, they concluded that for the New Testament Tyndale's contribution is about 83% of the text, and in the Old Testament 76%. Thus the Matthew Bible, though largely unrecognized, significantly shaped and influenced English Bible versions in the centuries that followed its first appearance. (Wikipedia)",

            "description": "The Souldier’s Pocket Bible has a fascinating history connecting the American and English Civil Wars.  Originally published in 1643 during the English Civil war, the booklet is a collection of 125 verses from the Geneva Bible translation to encourage soldiers in Oliver Cromwell’s army.  Only three original copies of this pamphlet are known.  Antiquarian George Livermore discovered one in 1854; he later reprinted it for use by soldiers in the American Civil War.<br><br>The Christian Soldiers Penny Bible is for the most part the same as The Souldier’s Pocket Bible, though somewhat enlarged and with a different title.  in The Penny Bible, the texts are quoted from the King Jame Bible, with some slight alterations.<br><br>Numerous organizations worked to provide Bibles and spiritual nourishment to the troops, North and South.  At its annual meeting, May 9, 1861, President Frelinghuysen of the American Bible Society (ABS) stated: “While there is much to alarm and afflict us in the political agitations of our country, on thing is our special comfort in the cause of the Bible Society: We are still one, bound together by the bonds of Christian kindness, animated by like hopes, earnest in like purposes and cheered by the same sympathies.”<br><br>The ABS had 16 printing presses operating in New York.  The first year of the war the society printed 370,000 more Bibles than the previous year.  During the war the ABS distributed a total of 760,773 Scriptures to the armed services and 823,566 additional Scriptures through the Christian Commission.  Some 300,000 Bibles, New Testaments, or portions were distributed throughout the South, though the wartime blockade often hindered distribution in the South.<br><br>This 1861 New Testament is the first edition printed by the American Bible Society specifically for distribution among Civil war Troops.  Knowing Soldiers would have difficulty carrying about the normal size Bible, the ABS printed user-friendly pocket size New Testaments.  During the Civil War, the ABS distributed over 1.5 million Bibles to both Union and Confederate soldiers.  ",

One of the foremost teachers of his age, and the first Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Cambridge, he played a great part in the revival of Greek learning in England. He was tutor to Prince Edward, the future King Edward VI, and also sometimes to Princess Elizabeth. Of strongly Reformist sympathy in religious affairs, his public career as provost of King's College, Cambridge, Member of Parliament and briefly as Secretary of State during King Edward's reign was brought to a close by the accession of Queen Mary in 1553. He went into voluntary exile abroad, at first under royal licence (which he overstayed). He was captured and imprisoned in 1556, and under threat or apprehension of execution by the fire made a forced public recantation and affiliated himself to the Church of Rome. He died not long afterwards, filled with remorse for having forsworn his true belief from the infirmity of fear. His character, teaching and reputation were, however, admiringly and honourably upheld.",

London: Richard Taylor & Co., 1808. An American edition was distributed by William Wells of Boston in 1809. A fourth London edition “with corrections and additions” was printed by Richard and Arthur Taylor in 1817. These three editions were published online by Google Books in 2007-2008: London, 1808; Boston, 1809; London, 1817<br><br>This “Improved” version of the New Testament was a revision of Newcome’s version (1796), and was published anonymously, by what the title page called “A Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue by the Distribution of Books.” The publisher’s use of the phrase “Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge” was apparently designed to give people the impression that the version was published by the well-known Anglican organization of that name founded by Thomas Bray in 1698, whose mission was to make inexpensive editions of uncontroversial, orthodox Christian books available to poor churches abroad. The Introduction neglects to mention the fact that the “Society” referred to on the title page was actually the Unitarian Society, and that the sole purpose of the version was to promote Unitarian ideas. The concealment of its true purpose was deliberate, as its principal editor later explained: “the editors … thought it needless to insert the word Unitarian in the title page, which would deter some ignorant and prejudiced people from looking into a work from which they might otherwise derive instruction.” It soon became known, however, that the version was financed by the Unitarians and done mainly by Thomas Belsham, a notorious Unitarian controversialist. <br><br>Belsham, in an article published in 1820, explained that the “main object” of the version was “to serve as a sort of common-place book to the New Testament, by exhibiting to the inquiring and serious reader a plain and faithful account of the manner in which the most learned and approved Unitarian writers translate and explain the texts upon which the Unitarian controversy hinges, and the grounds of their interpretation.” This statement of the version’s purpose was also rather misleading, however, because Unitarianism, though it ostensibly based its doctrine upon interpretations of biblical texts, was not really based upon the Bible at all.

It was completed by more than 25 scholars – experts in the original biblical languages - who worked directly from the best currently available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. Turn the pages and see the breadth of the translators’ notes, documenting their decisions and choices as they worked. The translators’ notes make the original languages far more accessible, allowing you to look over the translator's shoulder at the very process of translation. This level of documentation is a first for a Bible translation, making transparent the textual basis and the rationale for key renderings (including major interpretive options and alternative translations). This unparalleled level of detail helps connect people to the Bible in the original languages in a way never before possible without years of study of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. It unlocks the riches of the Bible’s truth from entirely new perspectives.<br>Copyright ©1996-2006 by Biblical Studies Press.",

London: for T. Becket and Others, 1768.<br><br>This is a paraphrase of the New Testament done by a classical scholar, Edward Harwood (1729-1794). His object was “To translate the sacred writers of the New Testament with the same freedom, impartiality, and elegance, with which other translations from the Greek classics have lately been executed, and to cloathe the genuine ideas and doctrines of the Apostles with that propriety and perspicuity, in which they themselves, I apprehend, would have exhibited them had they now lived and written in our language.” (Preface).<br><br>Harwood’s paraphrase imitates the verbose and ornate style of writing typical of much English prose of the eighteenth century, and has often been cited as an outstanding example of poor taste and inappropriate handling of Scripture. Shortly after its publication James Boswell called it a “ridiculous work.” 1 Others have called it “turgid,” “absurd,” and worse. In a discussion of the qualities of various English versions, Richard C. Trench wrote, “Of Harwood’s Liberal Translation of the New Testament (London, 1768), and the follies of it, not very far from blasphemous, it is unnecessary to give any specimens.” 2 J. Isaacs observes that Harwood’s version is “one of the most discussed and insulted” versions of the eighteenth century. 3 A specimen often quoted is the rendering of the Lord’s Prayer in Matthew 6.",

            "title_vernacular": null,
            "description": "By the mid-18th century the wide variation in the various modernized printed texts of the Authorized Version, combined with the notorious accumulation of misprints, had reached the proportion of a scandal, and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge both sought to produce an updated standard text. First of the two was the Cambridge edition of 1760, the culmination of 20 years' work by Francis Sawyer Parris, who died in May of that year. This 1760 edition was reprinted without change in 1762 and in John Baskerville's fine folio edition of 1763. This was effectively superseded by the 1769 Oxford edition, edited by Benjamin Blayney, though with comparatively few changes from Parris's edition; but which became the Oxford standard text, and is reproduced almost unchanged in most current printings. Parris and Blayney sought consistently to remove those elements of the 1611 and subsequent editions that they believed were due to the vagaries of printers, while incorporating most of the revised readings of the Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638, and each also introducing a few improved readings of their own. They undertook the mammoth task of standardizing the wide variation in punctuation and spelling of the original, making many thousands of minor changes to the text. In addition, Blayney and Parris thoroughly revised and greatly extended the italicization of \"supplied\" words not found in the original languages by cross-checking against the presumed source texts. Blayney seems to have worked from the 1550 Stephanus edition of the Textus Receptus, rather than the later editions of Theodore Beza that the translators of the 1611 New Testament had favoured; accordingly the current Oxford standard text alters around a dozen italicizations where Beza and Stephanus differ. Like the 1611 edition, the 1769 Oxford edition included the Apocrypha, although Blayney tended to remove cross-references to the Books of the Apocrypha from the margins of their Old and New Testaments wherever these had been provided by the original translators. Altogether, the standardization of spelling and punctuation caused Blayney's 1769 text to differ from the 1611 text in around 24,000 places. Since that date, a few further changes have been introduced to the Oxford standard text. The Oxford University Press paperback edition of the \"Authorized King James Version\" provides Oxford's standard text, and also includes the prefatory section \"The Translators to the Reader\".<br><br>The 1611 and 1769 texts of the first three verses from I Corinthians 13 are given below.<br><br>[1611] 1. Though I speake with the tongues of men & of Angels, and haue not charity, I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I haue the gift of prophesie, and vnderstand all mysteries and all knowledge: and though I haue all faith, so that I could remooue mountaines, and haue no charitie, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore, and though I giue my body to bee burned, and haue not charitie, it profiteth me nothing.<br><br>[1769] 1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<br><br>There are a number of superficial edits in these three verses: 11 changes of spelling, 16 changes of typesetting (including the changed conventions for the use of u and v), three changes of punctuation, and one variant text—where \"not charity\" is substituted for \"no charity\" in verse two, in the erroneous belief that the original reading was a misprint.<br><br>A particular verse for which Blayney's 1769 text differs from Parris's 1760 version is Matthew 5:13, where Parris (1760) has<br><br>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and to be troden under foot of men.<br><br>Blayney (1769) changes 'lost his savour' to 'lost its savour', and troden to trodden.<br><br>For a period, Cambridge continued to issue Bibles using the Parris text, but the market demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually adapted Blayney's work but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings. By the mid-19th century, almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text—increasingly without Blayney's variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition (including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original), published by Oxford in 1833. Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who for the first time consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, like Blayney, opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which followed in the spirit of Scrivener's work, attempting to bring spelling to present-day standards. Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks, while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text, so far as possible, to the wording used by its translators, especially in the light of the re-emphasis on some of their draft documents. This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin Books.<br><br>From the early 19th century the Authorized Version has remained almost completely unchanged—and since, due to advances in printing technology, it could now be produced in very large editions for mass sale, it established complete dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English-speaking Protestant world. Academic debate through that century, however, increasingly reflected concerns about the Authorized Version shared by some scholars: (a) that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the translation of the Hebrew Bible—both in terms of specific vocabulary, and also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names; (b) that the Authorized Version was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and phrases into different English, especially where parallel passages are found in the synoptic gospels; and (c) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript discoveries, the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original text.<br><br>Responding to these concerns, the Convocation of Canterbury resolved in 1870 to undertake a revision of the text of the Authorized Version, intending to retain the original text \"except where in the judgement of competent scholars such a change is necessary\". The resulting revision was issued as the Revised Version in 1881 (New Testament), 1885 (Old Testament) and 1894 (Apocrypha); but, although it sold widely, the revision did not find popular favour, and it was only reluctantly in 1899 that Convocation approved it for reading in churches.<br><br>By the early 20th century, editing had been completed in Cambridge's text, with at least 6 new changes since 1769, and the reversing of at least 30 of the standard Oxford readings. The distinct Cambridge text was printed in the millions, and after the Second World War \"the unchanging steadiness of the KJB was a huge asset.\" The Cambridge edition is preferred by scholars.<br><br>The Authorized Version maintained its effective dominance throughout the first half of the 20th century. New translations in the second half of the 20th century displaced its 250 years of dominance (roughly 1700 to 1950), but groups do exist—sometimes termed the King James Only movement—that distrust anything not in agreement with the Authorized Version.

Such Bibles were at one time very popular in Great Britain and America and were used as a means of teaching Scripture to children in a direct, simple, and interesting way. Presented here is the first American hieroglyphic Bible, A Curious Hieroglyphick Bible, or, Select Passages in the Old and New Testaments, produced in 1788 by the preeminent early American printer and pioneer publisher of children’s literature Isaiah Thomas (1749‒1831). A landmark in 18th-century American book illustration, the Bible contains nearly 500 woodcuts by American artists and is the most ambitious woodcut book produced in America up to that time. In his preface, Thomas offers the book not only as a pleasing method of teaching Bible lessons to children, but as “an easy Way of leading them on in Reading.” Thomas learned the art of engraving while apprenticed in his youth to the Boston printer Zechariah Fowle. Based primarily in Worcester, Massachusetts, Thomas produced 65 children’s books and is widely acclaimed as America’s first enlightened printer of such books, often compared with John Newbery of London, England, with whom he shared the motto, “Instruction with delight.” The book was inscribed by its first owner, “Enoch Brooks’ Book, Princeton, March 13th, 1789.” It is one of four copies of the book known to exist today.

            "description": "The King James Version (KJV), also the King James Bible (KJB) and the Authorized Version, is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England, which was commissioned in 1604 and published in 1611, by sponsorship of King James VI and I. The books of the King James Version include the 39 books of the Old Testament, an intertestamental section containing 14 books of the Apocrypha, and the 27 books of the New Testament. Noted for its \"majesty of style\", the King James Version has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English-speaking world.<br>.By the first half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version had become effectively unchallenged as the English translation used in Anglican and other English Protestant churches, except for the Psalms and some short passages in the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England. Over the course of the 18th century, the Authorized Version supplanted the Latin Vulgate as the standard version of scripture for English-speaking scholars. With the development of stereotype printing at the beginning of the 19th century, this version of the Bible became the most widely printed book in history, almost all such printings presenting the standard text of 1769 extensively re-edited by Benjamin Blayney at Oxford, and nearly always omitting the books of the Apocrypha. Today the unqualified title \"King James Version\" usually indicates this Oxford standard text.",

In Comstock’s words, his translation of the Bible was “translated out of the original Greek, and with the form translations diligently compared and revised.” Comstock claimed that his phonetic alphabet was the best of the seven known to exist at that time, and his hope was that his translation would also aid in the evangelism of those for whom English was not their native tongue, particularly “the heathen.” According to Dr. Paul Keen, this is a very rare first edition. Within the text, there is a table that explains the alphabet and the sounds that the characters are meant to make.",

            "description": "The Douay–Rheims Bible (also known as the Rheims–Douai Bible or Douai Bible, and abbreviated as D–R and DRB) is a translation of the Bible from the Latin Vulgate into English made by members of the English College, Douai, in the service of the Catholic Church. The New Testament portion was published in Reims, France, in 1582, in one volume with extensive commentary and notes. The Old Testament portion was published in two volumes twenty-seven years later in 1609 and 1610 by the University of Douai. The first volume, covering Genesis through Job, was published in 1609; the second, covering Psalms to 2 Machabees plus the deuterocanonical books of the Vulgate, was published in 1610. Marginal notes took up the bulk of the volumes and had a strong polemical and patristic character. They offered insights on issues of translation, and on the Hebrew and Greek source texts of the Vulgate.<br><br>The purpose of the version, both the text and notes, was to uphold Catholic tradition in the face of the Protestant Reformation which up till then had dominated Elizabethan religion and academic debate. As such it was an effort by English Catholics to support the Counter-Reformation. The New Testament was reprinted in 1600, 1621 and 1633. The Old Testament volumes were reprinted in 1635 but neither thereafter for another hundred years. In 1589, William Fulke collated the complete Rheims text and notes in parallel columns with those of the Bishops' Bible. This work sold widely in England, being re-issued in three further editions to 1633. It was predominantly through Fulke's editions that the Rheims New Testament came to exercise a significant influence on the development of 17th century English.<br><br>Much of the text of the 1582/1610 bible employed a densely Latinate vocabulary, making it extremely difficult to read the text in places. Consequently, this translation was replaced by a revision undertaken by bishop Richard Challoner; the New Testament in three editions of 1749, 1750, and 1752; the Old Testament (minus the Vulgate apocrypha), in 1750. Although retaining the title Douay–Rheims Bible, the Challoner revision was a new version, tending to take as its base text the King James Version rigorously checked and extensively adjusted for improved readability and consistency with the Clementine edition of the Vulgate. Subsequent editions of the Challoner revision, of which there have been very many, reproduce his Old Testament of 1750 with very few changes. Challoner's New Testament was, however, extensively revised by Bernard MacMahon in a series of Dublin editions from 1783 to 1810. These Dublin versions are the source of some Challoner bibles printed in the United States in the 19th century. Subsequent editions of the Challoner Bible printed in England most often follow Challoner's earlier New Testament texts of 1749 and 1750, as do most 20th-century printings and on-line versions of the Douay–Rheims bible circulating on the internet.<br><br>Although the Jerusalem Bible, New American Bible Revised Edition, Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, and New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition are the most commonly used Bibles in English-speaking Catholic churches, the Challoner revision of the Douay–Rheims often remains the Bible of choice of more-traditional English-speaking Catholics.

Leeser wanted to strengthen the Jewish community in its traditions so it would not be assimilated by Protestant America. Many Jews of that day did not read Hebrew and were reading the King James Bible. Leeser believed Jews should have their own translation of the Scriptures, free from Christian interpretation. He spent fifteen years, in the midst of many other projects, preparing his Bible translation “after the best Jewish authorities.” Bertram Korn summarized Leeser’s accomplishments for American Judaism: “Practically every form of Jewish activity which supports American Jewish life today was either established or envisaged by this one man. Almost every kind of publication which is essential to Jewish survival was written, translated, or fostered by him.”",

First editions of Taverner's Bible are extremely rare.<br><br>The successful sale of Matthew's Bible, the private venture of the two printers Grafton and Whitchurch, was threatened by a rival edition published in 1539 in folio (Herbert #45) by \"John Byddell for Thomas Barthlet\" with Richard Taverner as editor. This was, in fact, what would now be called \"piracy,\" being Grafton's Matthew Bible revised by Taverner, a learned member of the Inner Temple and famous Greek scholar. He made many alterations in the Matthew Bible, characterized by critical acumen and a happy choice of strong and idiomatic expressions.<br><br>His revision seems to have had little influence on subsequent translators, although a few phrases in the King James Bible can be traced to it. Daniell sums up its influence, \"indeed a version which had no influence\".<br><br>It was not reprinted in its entirety. Quarto and octavo editions of the New Testament alone were published in the same year as the original edition, and the Old Testament was reprinted as part of a Bible in 1551. The Old Testament and Apocrypha were also issued by Day and Seres in five sections (Herbert #81, #82, #86, #87, #94) between 1549 and 1551.

The 1917 Tanakh takes into account the Septuagint, the Targums, the Peshitta, the Vulgate, and numerous other translation traditions. It offers a uniquely Jewish translation for the English-speaking world. The resulting work is still in wide use nearly a century after its original publication.",

This commentary first appeared in 1703, and has since been frequently printed with Bp. Patrick's Paraphrase and Commentary on the Historical and Poetical Books, and Mr. Lowth's Paraphrase, &c. on the Prophetical Books of the Qld Testament. The two last-mentioned works would have been inserted in the present list, but that the most valuable of their anno tations are included in Dr. D'Oyly's and Bp. Mant's Commentary already noticed.

            "description": "The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The Common English Version, Corrected by the Final Committee of the American Bible Union. New York: American Bible Union, 1862-64. This thorough revision of the 1850 edtion was prepared by various scholars and edited by Thomas J. Conant, Horatio B. Hackett, and Asahel C. Kendrick. It was first issued in parts, the Gospels appearing in 1862, and Acts through II Corinthians in 1863. A volume containing the complete NT first appeared in 1864.<br><br>The first edition (1850) is a moderate revision of the KJV New Testament produced by some officers of the American and Foreign Bible Society. The Society had been formed by American Baptists in 1837, for the purpose of aiding Baptist missionary translators, and some prominent members wished to produce or sponsor a revision of the KJV. But others questioned the wisdom of the proposal. One man who was involved in these events, Thomas Armitage, reports that the Society's President and Secretary made this provisional edition on their own initiative after one member suggested that \"those in favor of a revision of the English Scriptures should issue, in the form of a small edition of the New Testament, a specimen of the character of the emendations which they desired .... Deacon William Colgate, the Treasurer, said that he approved of this suggestion, and that if Brethren Cone and Wyckoff would procure and issue such an edition as a personal enterprise, he, as a friend of revision, would personally pay the cost of the plates and printing. This was done, and in their preface they stated that .... they submitted their work, not for acceptance by the Society, but as a specimen of some changes which might be properly made, and that the plates would be presented to the Society if they were desired.\"<br><br>In the Preface of the 1850 edition, Cone and Wyckoff describe their purpose thus:<br><br>That the truth of God should be rendered plain to the ordinary reader, is a proposition which none but a Romanist will be disposed to deny. Ignorance of what his Maker has revealed, cannot benefit men, error and misconception must injure him. Every child of light will seek to know the truth, and will desire to make it known to others. By suitable efforts to enlighten his fellow creatures in the things of the kingdom, he promotes their welfare, and advances the declaratory glory of the Author of all truth. With these views and objects, the editors have prepared this amended edition of the New Testament, by diligently comparing it with the original Greek, availing themselves of the labors of learned and godly commentators of the last two hundred years, and submitting the emendations made to several eminent Biblical scholars. They do not pretend to have corrected every error and fault of the commonly received version; but they believe that they have removed many of its most objectionable blemishes, and have so far made \"a good translation better.\" This book is designed for the examination of the members of the American and Foreign Bible Society, to convince them that the common version can be corrected without injury to its characteristic excellencies, and with great enhancement of its real value. The plates have been made at the expense of a few benevolent individuals, and will be offered to the society, in connection with a proposition that a committee of learned brethren be appointed to correspond upon the subject of further emendations, and once a year to submit to the board those on which they unanimously agree. These, if approved by the board, may be introduced into the plates, and the business of rectification be thus gradually prosecuted, until the society is prepared to approve and adopt the book as a standard.<br><br>Read More http://www.bible-researcher.com/abu.html.",

            "description": "The translation which is here offered follows the Greek closely, diverging from it only where it seems probable, or certain, from recognition of the underlying Semitic idiom, that the Greek rendering causes misunderstanding. .Jesus and his disciples spoke and wrote Aramaic. His reported discourses and the earliest accounts of his deeds were written down and circulated in that language. In what way these primitive records were related to our Four Gospels is a question which hitherto has not received any satisfactory answer. There is clear and complete evidence that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John were composed in Aramaic on the basis of diverse written material widespread in Palestine, and that our Greek is the result of literal translation. There is very good reason to believe that Mk. was written in the year 40, Mt. a short time after. Each of these two Gospels was rendered into Greek very soon after its first appearance. The Gospel of Jn., composed in Palestine, presumably in Jerusalem, seems to have been soon carried away, to be translated into Greek many years later in a foreign land, perhaps at Ephesus. Luke compiled his Gospel from Semitic sources only, collected by himself and rendered into Greek with remarkable faithfulness. The document comprising the first two chapters was Hebrew, the rest Aramaic. The Greek text which is here followed is almost always that of Westcott and Hort. The test of translation seems to show that the text of Codex B stands very near indeed to that ofthe original translators.",

Worrell sought to update the accuracy and grammar of the King James Version in his translation of the New Testament and included his personal study notes in it as well.<br><br>Worrell introduced the work as follows:<br><br>This translation is the outgrowth of a solemn conviction that such a work was required of the writer by Him Whose he is, and Whom he seeks to serve. The translator, A. S. Worrell, spent two and one-half years devoted to the work. It was done with the view of pleasing the Supreme Critic, at Whose judgment bar he will have to account for the manner in which he has handled His word.<br><br>The work was begun and prosecuted under the distinct conviction that these New Testament Scriptures are the veritable word of God – His last revelation to this sin-cursed world. The translator believed that these Scriptures contain nothing but \"live matter\"; and that they are as true now and as applicable to man's needs as a tripartite being as they ever were.",

He wrote a number of theological works, including a defense of miracles in response to David Hume, and was noted for originality of argument as well as charity towards his opponents. This translation of the Gospels was first published in England in 1789; the work consists of a preface and preliminary dissertations, the actual translation, and the notes, with the whole being very scholarly, resorting frequently to the Greek in the dissertations and notes.<br><br>George Campbell is now remembered primarily for The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1776). Here he employed the Scottish Enlightenment’s developing science of human nature to explain the effectiveness of the classical rules of rhetoric. He did this by relating the various ends of persuasive discourse to the natural faculties and propensities of the human mind. In his own time Campbell was better known as a religious apologist, using an enlightened theory of evidence in A Dissertation on Miracles (1762) to defend the believability of Christian miracles against the sceptical attack of David Hume.",

            "description": "The Common English Bible is unlike any other translation. It’s uncommon in that it’s the newest translation by the largest number of biblical scholars & church leaders in words 21st century readers use every day, aligning academic rigor with modern understandability, proven through extensive affirmation with, and acting on feedback from, hundreds of readers. The new Common English Bible is the only translation to combine and balance highly respected ecumenical biblical scholarship necessary for serious study with responsiveness to 21st century clear communication requirements for comprehensive clarity.<br>The Common English Bible is the result of collaboration between opposites: scholars working with average readers; conservatives working with liberals; teens working with retirees; men working with women; many denominations and many ethnicities coming together around the common goal of creating a translation that unites rather than divides, with the ultimate goal of mutually accomplishing God’s overall work in the world.<br>Combining scholarly accuracy with vivid language, the Common English Bible is the work of 120 biblical scholars from 24 denominations in American, African, Asian, European, and Latino communities, representing such academic institutions as Asbury Theological Seminary, Azusa Pacific University, Bethel Seminary, Denver Seminary, Princeton Theological Seminary, Seattle Pacific University, Wheaton College, Yale University, and many others. They meticulously translated the Bible into English directly from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.<br>Additionally, more than 500 readers in 77 groups field-tested the translation. Every verse was read aloud in the reading groups, where potentially confusing passages were identified. The translators considered the groups' responses and, where necessary, reworked those passages to clarify in English their meaning from the original languages. In total, more than 600 people worked jointly to bring the Common English Bible to fruition.<br>In 2010 the New Testament was published. In 2011 the complete Bible was published with the Old Testament and the availability of the Apocrypha.",

Messianic rabbis, leaders, scholars, artists, professors, psalmists, linguists, writers, parents, and children came together to work on this groundbreaking version that is meant for the entire family to read and enjoy together. Wisdom is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, and happy are those who hold her fast (Proverbs 3:18). If you are a Jew who is curious about Messiah, this book will help you, with guidance from the Holy Spirit, to see how Yeshua became the Prophet, like Moses, full of glory, grace, and truth. Compare what the New Covenant says with what the Hebrew Bible says-the footnotes point the way for you. Many modern-day Christians recognize the value of rediscovering the Jewish roots of their faith, and Messianic Jews are growing in numbers and scholarship. The middle wall of partition is crumbling, and unity is being restored, teaching that diversity is strength.<br>Copyright  © 2013, 2018 Messianic Jewish Family Bible.",

In this work he first produced a careful collation of the readings of the chief manuscripts and the researches of the ripest continental scholarship of his day. Philological rather than theological in character, it marked an epochal change from the old homiletic commentary, and though more recent research, patristic and papyral, has largely changed the method of New Testament exegesis, Alford's work is still a quarry where the student can dig with a good deal of profit. See Alford's Law for an example.<br><br>Alford subsequently published the New Testament for English Readers (4 vols., Rivingtons, 1868).",

            "description": "The Bay Psalm Book is a metrical Psalter first printed in 1640 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was the first book printed in British North America. The Psalms in it are metrical translations into English. The translations are not particularly polished, and not one has remained in use, although some of the tunes to which they were sung have survived (for instance, \"Old 100th\"). However, its production, just 20 years after the Pilgrims' arrival at Plymouth, Massachusetts, represents a considerable achievement. It went through several editions and remained in use for well over a century.<br><br>In November 2013, one of eleven known surviving copies of the first edition sold at auction for $14.2 million, a record for a printed book.<br><br>The early residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony brought with them several books of psalms: the Ainsworth Psalter (1612), compiled by Henry Ainsworth for use by Puritan \"separatists\" in Holland; the Ravenscroft Psalter (1621); and the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter (1562), of which there were several editions. Evidently they were dissatisfied with the translations from Hebrew in these several psalters and wished for some that were closer to the original. They hired \"thirty pious and learned Ministers\", including Richard Mather, Thomas Mayhew, and John Eliot, to undertake a new translation, which they presented here. The tunes to be sung to the new translations were the familiar ones from their existing psalters.<br><br>The first printing was the third product of the Stephen Day (sometimes spelled Daye) press, and consisted of a 148 small quarto leaves, including a 12-page preface, \"The Psalmes in Metre\", \"An Admonition to the Reader\", and an extensive list of errata headed \"Faults escaped in printing\". As with subsequent editions of the book, Day printed the book for sale by the first bookseller in British America, Hezekiah Usher, whose shop at that time was also located in Cambridge. An estimated 1,700 copies of the first edition were printed.<br><br>The third edition (1651) was extensively revised by Henry Dunster and Richard Lyon. The revision was entitled The Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs of the Old and New Testament, faithfully translated into English metre. This revision was the basis for all subsequent editions, and was popularly known as the New England Psalter or New England Version. The ninth edition (1698), the first to contain music, included 13 tunes from John Playford's A Breefe Introduction to the Skill of Musick (London, 1654).<br><br>The expansion of the neoclassical movement in England led to an evolution in the singing of psalms. These changes found their way to America and subsequently new psalm versions were written. In the early part of the 18th century several updated psalms, notably those written by Tate and Brady and by Isaac Watts, were published. Shortly thereafter several congregations in New England elected to replace the Bay Psalm Book with these new titles.<br><br>In 1718, Cotton Mather undertook the revision of the original Bay Psalm Book which he had studied since youth. Two subsequent revisions were published in 1752, by John Barnard of Marblehead and in 1758 by Thomas Prince. Prince was a clergyman at the Old South Church in Boston. He convinced the members of the congregation of the need to produce a revised, more scholarly, edition of the Bay Psalm Book. Unfortunately, Prince’s version was not accepted outside of his membership and in 1789, the Old South Church reverted to the earlier edition published by Isaac Watts.  (Wikipedia)",

Tyndale's Bible is credited with being the first English translation to work directly from Hebrew and Greek texts. Furthermore, it was the first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in the art of printing.<br><br>The term Tyndale's Bible is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete Bible. That task was completed by Miles Coverdale, who supplemented Tyndale's translations with his own to produce the first complete printed Bible in English in 1535. Prior to his execution Tyndale had only finished translating the entire New Testament and roughly half of the Old Testament. Of the latter, the Pentateuch, Jonah and a revised version of the book of Genesis were published during his lifetime. His other Old Testament works were first used in the creation of the Matthew Bible and also heavily influenced every major English translation of the Bible that followed.<br><br>1525 Tyndale, William (The New Testament) [Cologne: Peter Quentell, 1525.]<br>[Only a fragment, 'The gospell of S.

            "description": "George Barker Stevens (1854-1906) was a professor at Yale when he published this paraphrase of Paul’s Epistles.<br><br>His college course was begun at Cornell, and completed at Rochester, where he graduated in 1877. After a year of theological study in the Baptist Seminary at Rochester, he came to New Haven, and graduated from Yale Divinity School in 1880. He was pastor of the First Congregational Church in Buffalo for two years, and then for three years of the First Presbyterian Church in Watertown, N.Y. In 1883 he gained the degree of Ph.D. from Syracuse University. The years 1885-6 he spent as a student in Germany; and earned the degree of D.D. at Jena, where he studied especially under Lipsius. He was then called to the chair of New Testament criticism and interpretation at Yale, succeeding Dr. Dwight, who entered on the presidency of the university, in 1886. This chair he held until 1895, when he was chosen to succeed the late Dr. Samuel Harris as Dwight professor of systematic theology.<br><br>In 1892 Stevens had published a major study of Pauline theology, 2 and we might naturally expect to find in this paraphrase of Paul’s epistles a reflection of the interpretations set forth in his earlier treatise. In fact we do find such a relationship in places, but it is most striking how the whole rationale of the paraphrase really contradicts what Stevens says in Pauline theology about the importance of taking seriously the forms of expression used by Paul, as indispensible keys to the true apprehension of his meaning:<br><br>Of greater importance for our present purpose than the consideration of Paul’s style is the study of the characteristics of his thinking and his favorite modes of presenting his thoughts, in order to gain a just conception of his teaching upon special subjects. By this study is meant something more than an examination of style; it includes the thought-forms which lie behind style,—the moulds into which ideas are run.<br><br>This subject has never received sufficient attention. Interpreters have too often taken up the Pauline letters without reference to the environment in which they were produced, the peculiarities of the writer, or the special ends contemplated in his writings. Upon his words have been put meanings which belong to opinions and speculations which he never entertained, and around his teaching have been thrown associations wholly foreign to his own type of thought. Paul has been read as if he had written in the nineteenth century (or more commonly as if he had written in the fifth or seventeenth), and as if his writings had no peculiarities arising from his own time, education, and mental constitution.",

The text contains doctrinal and practical notes throughout which are characteristically plain and brief but meant to help the reader in understanding the text. His paraphrase was also meant to aid families in daily reading and to help all people read and understand the New Testament.

Consequently, it was almost universally panned. David Daniel the preface to his seminal edition of the William Tyndale New Testament, says that the Bishops' Bible \"was, and is, not loved. Where it reprints Geneva it is acceptable, but most of the original work is incompetent, both in its scholarship and its verbosity.\" After a period of heavy revision, it was supplanted by the King James Bible in 1611.",

Furthermore, it was the first English biblical translation that was mass-produced as a result of new advances in the art of printing.<br><br>The term Tyndale's Bible is not strictly correct, because Tyndale never published a complete Bible. That task was completed by Miles Coverdale, who supplemented Tyndale's translations with his own to produce the first complete printed Bible in English in 1535. Prior to his execution Tyndale had only finished translating the entire New Testament and roughly half of the Old Testament. Of the latter, the Pentateuch, Jonah and a revised version of the book of Genesis were published during his lifetime. His other Old Testament works were first used in the creation of the Matthew Bible and also heavily influenced every major English translation of the Bible that followed.<br><br>1525 Tyndale, William (The New Testament) [Cologne: Peter Quentell, 1525.]<br>[Only a fragment, 'The gospell of S.

The work took 19 years to complete and was originally published in 1808. Thomson is credited with having created the work with little to no help from other scholars. Charles Thomson was a Greek scholar, and before the American Revolution, had been a teacher at several prominent schools. Thomson's translation of the entire Greek Bible, excluding the Apocrypha, was published in one-thousand sets of four volumes each, the fourth volume being Thomson's translation of the New Testament in that same year. The printer was Jane Aitken of Philadelphia.<br><br>Thomson's was the first English translation of the Septuagint published, and was considered by British biblical scholars to represent the best in American scholarship. David Daniell, in his compendious work The Bible in English (2003), states that the scholars who worked on the Revised Version in England (1881) consulted Thomson's translations (among others, of course) during their work. Thomson's translation of the New Covenant/Testament is the first American translation of the New Covenant.<br><br>Thomson's personal copy, containing final corrections to the manuscript, is in the Philadelphia library.<br><br>Charles Thomson also published a Synopsis of the Four Evangelists in 1815, a book which came out of the notes for this work.<br><br>Charles Thomson (1729–1824) was secretary of the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1789.

            "description": "The Catholic Public Domain Version (CPDV) is a fairly-literal modern English edition of the Bible, translated from the Pope Sixtus V and Pope Clement VIII Latin Vulgate, using the Challoner Douay Rheims version as a guide. The CPDV is specifically a Roman Catholic translation, which translates both the Old and the New Testaments in the light of Roman Catholic doctrine, in order to make the text more accessible to the Catholic reader. The CPDV carefully avoids inclusive language, instead translating each noun that refers to human persons in accordance with the gender and number of the source text. The word meaning 'sons' is translated as 'sons', the word meaning 'brothers' is translated as 'brothers', and so on. The Vatican norms for Bible translation reject the use of inclusive or gender-neutral language. And yet many modern translations have thoroughly integrated this type of language into the text of the Bible to make it politically-correct.",

The work took 19 years to complete and was originally published in 1808. Thomson is credited with having created the work with little to no help from other scholars. Charles Thomson was a Greek scholar, and before the American Revolution, had been a teacher at several prominent schools. Thomson's translation of the entire Greek Bible, excluding the Apocrypha, was published in one-thousand sets of four volumes each, the fourth volume being Thomson's translation of the New Testament in that same year. The printer was Jane Aitken of Philadelphia.<br><br>Thomson's was the first English translation of the Septuagint published, and was considered by British biblical scholars to represent the best in American scholarship. David Daniell, in his compendious work The Bible in English (2003), states that the scholars who worked on the Revised Version in England (1881) consulted Thomson's translations (among others, of course) during their work. Thomson's translation of the New Covenant/Testament is the first American translation of the New Covenant.<br><br>Thomson's personal copy, containing final corrections to the manuscript, is in the Philadelphia library.<br><br>Charles Thomson also published a Synopsis of the Four Evangelists in 1815, a book which came out of the notes for this work.<br><br>Charles Thomson (1729–1824) was secretary of the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1789.

Work on most books of the Old Testament, begun in 1994 and completed in 2001, was done by forty revisers and a board of eight editors. The 1991 revision of the Psalter, the work of thirty revisers and six editors, was further revised by seven revisers and two editors between 2009 and 2010. As suggested in the comments above, the revision aimed at making use of the best manuscript traditions available (see below), translating as accurately as possible, and rendering the result in good contemporary English. In many ways it is a more literal translation than the original NAB and has attempted to be more consistent in rendering Hebrew (or Greek) words and idioms, especially in technical contexts, such as regulations for sacrifices. In translating the Psalter special effort was made to provide a smooth, rhythmic translation for easy singing or recitation, and to retain the concrete imagery of the Hebrew.<br> Copyright © 2010, 1991, 1986, 1970 Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, Inc.",

New York: Greenwood Press.<br><br>Philip Doddridge was an early 18th century non-conformist pastor, and like Matthew Henry, he spent much of his free time writing his commentary. Doddridge notes in the preface that he intended this commentary to be used by families at the dinner table. The forgotten practice of family worship is a great way to use this commentary; the expanded translation, and the devotions at the end of each section (see below) work together seamlessly as a perfect tool for family devotional reading and discussion. This may well be the book that Jonathan Edwards used for his family devotions.<br><br>The Family Expositor is an extraordinary work. Doddridge deems it “a paraphrase,” but it is much more than that. Really it’s three works in one. It is a puritan translation and expansion on the text, a puritan commentary on the text, and a puritan devotional work on the text. Doddridge combines these three to make a truly great puritan companion to the New Testament. ",

            "description": "Robert Lowth (1710 – 1787) was a Bishop of the Church of England, Oxford Professor of Poetry and the author of one of the most influential textbooks of English grammar.<br><br>Lowth is among the first modern Bible scholar to notice or draw attention to the poetic structure of the Psalms and much of the prophetic literature of the Old Testament. He sets out the classic statement of parallelism, which remains the most fundamental category for understanding Hebrew poetry. He identifies three forms of parallelism, the synonymous, antithetic and synthetic (i.e., balance only in the manner of expression without either synonymy or antithesis). This idea has been influential in Old Testament Studies to the present day.<br><br>Between 1741 and 1750 Robert Lowth presented a series of groundbreaking lectures that reimagined the Hebrew Bible as literature, emphasizing its artful formal qualities. Today he is best known for rediscovering the parallelism of ancient Hebrew poetry, which he imagined as originating in the responsive singing of the seraphim. At a time when the divine authority of the Bible was waning, the reclassification of large swaths of prophecy as poetry helped Lowth extol the human figure of the prophet as a literary genius. Lowth idealized the prophetic-poetic text as “strong”: artful, controlled, ordered, and balanced. He responded to an anxiety about the place of the Bible and biblical prophecy in eighteenth-century English society by disavowing or minimizing the irregularities, stutters, and fissures in prophecy. But by introducing prophecy into poetry, Lowth—with much ambivalence—also ushered more passion, enthusiasm, and subjectivity into neoclassical English poetry.",

His phonetic alphabet was meant to help his students speak better, particularly those with speech impediments. In Comstock’s words, his translation of the Bible was “translated out of the original Greek, and with the form translations diligently compared and revised.” Comstock claimed that his phonetic alphabet was the best of the seven known to exist at that time, and his hope was that his translation would also aid in the evangelism of those for whom English was not their native tongue, particularly “the heathen.” According to Dr. Paul Keen, this is a very rare first edition. Within the text, there is a table that explains the alphabet and the sounds that the characters are meant to make.",

The challenge for the translators was to create a text that would make the same impact in the life of modern readers that the original text had for the original readers. In the New Living Translation, this is accomplished by translating entire thoughts (rather than just words) into natural, everyday English. The end result is a translation that is easy to read and understand and that accurately communicates the meaning of the original text.<br>Copyright © 1996, 2004, 2007 by Tyndale House Foundation.",

The translation was published in two Volumes in London by W. Richardson and S. Clark in 1764, but is not generally regarded as successful.<br><br>A portion of Purver's translation was published in parts about 1742 by Felix Farley of Bristol, but the publication received little support. Purver failed to get the whole text published, and gained no backing for his venture, even by the Religious Society of Friends. Even when the Manuscript was published by Dr. John Fothergill at his own expense, the full translation also failed to make any impression.<br><br>Various reasons can be advanced for the failure of Purver’s translation; lack of publicity; the fact that it lacked authority (a one-man translation) and it had not been backed by any Church, not even the Religious Society of Friends, to which Purver belonged. Yet the failure to make its mark may owe itself to the deficiencies of his translation.<br><br>By some it is held to be an unreliable translation; the Dictionary of National Biography records that Purver \"…on arriving at a difficult passage, he would shut himself up for two or three days and nights, waiting for inspiration\" Charles Haddon Spurgeon, who was acquainted with Purver’s version remarks \"A Quaker Translation.

            "description": "The Bible in Worldwide English is largely Annie Cressman’s labor of love. Cressman was a Canadian teach who travelled moved to Liberia to teach English and the Bible, the latter often through the former. In describing her teaching process, she says that \"she found that she was spending more time explaining the meaning of the English than she was teaching the Bible itself, and, therefore, decided to write a simple version in easy English so that her students could easily understand.\" In 1959, she published her Gospel of Mark and SOON Publications in India helped her create  a complete New Testament in 1969. She continued translating portions of the Bible until her death in 1999. ",

Readable and reliable, GW is living, active, and life-changing. GW's publishers believe that communicating the original meaning of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts that comprise the Scriptures such that everyone can comprehend requires taking a completely new look at the original languages. Many modern translations, they argue, have chosen simply to follow the traditions of older accepted translations, though the traditional words and grammar may no longer mean what they once did, or are not understood.<br>Copyright © 1995 by God's Word to the Nations.
