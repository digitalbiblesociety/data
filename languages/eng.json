At its zenith in the 19th century the British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two world wars and the Irish Republic's withdrawal from the union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council and a founding member of NATO and the Commonwealth the UK pursues a global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the EU although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999.

It was the first book printed in British North America. The Psalms in it are metrical translations into English. The translations are not particularly polished, and not one has remained in use, although some of the tunes to which they were sung have survived (for instance, \"Old 100th\"). However, its production, just 20 years after the Pilgrims' arrival at Plymouth, Massachusetts, represents a considerable achievement. It went through several editions and remained in use for well over a century.<br><br>In November 2013, one of eleven known surviving copies of the first edition sold at auction for $14.2 million, a record for a printed book.<br><br>The early residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony brought with them several books of psalms: the Ainsworth Psalter (1612), compiled by Henry Ainsworth for use by Puritan \"separatists\" in Holland; the Ravenscroft Psalter (1621); and the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter (1562), of which there were several editions. Evidently they were dissatisfied with the translations from Hebrew in these several psalters and wished for some that were closer to the original. They hired \"thirty pious and learned Ministers\", including Richard Mather, Thomas Mayhew, and John Eliot, to undertake a new translation, which they presented here. The tunes to be sung to the new translations were the familiar ones from their existing psalters.<br><br>The first printing was the third product of the Stephen Day (sometimes spelled Daye) press, and consisted of a 148 small quarto leaves, including a 12-page preface, \"The Psalmes in Metre\", \"An Admonition to the Reader\", and an extensive list of errata headed \"Faults escaped in printing\". As with subsequent editions of the book, Day printed the book for sale by the first bookseller in British America, Hezekiah Usher, whose shop at that time was also located in Cambridge. An estimated 1,700 copies of the first edition were printed.<br><br>The third edition (1651) was extensively revised by Henry Dunster and Richard Lyon. The revision was entitled The Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs of the Old and New Testament, faithfully translated into English metre. This revision was the basis for all subsequent editions, and was popularly known as the New England Psalter or New England Version. The ninth edition (1698), the first to contain music, included 13 tunes from John Playford's A Breefe Introduction to the Skill of Musick (London, 1654).<br><br>The expansion of the neoclassical movement in England led to an evolution in the singing of psalms. These changes found their way to America and subsequently new psalm versions were written. In the early part of the 18th century several updated psalms, notably those written by Tate and Brady and by Isaac Watts, were published. Shortly thereafter several congregations in New England elected to replace the Bay Psalm Book with these new titles.<br><br>In 1718, Cotton Mather undertook the revision of the original Bay Psalm Book which he had studied since youth. Two subsequent revisions were published in 1752, by John Barnard of Marblehead and in 1758 by Thomas Prince. Prince was a clergyman at the Old South Church in Boston. He convinced the members of the congregation of the need to produce a revised, more scholarly, edition of the Bay Psalm Book. Unfortunately, Prince’s version was not accepted outside of his membership and in 1789, the Old South Church reverted to the earlier edition published by Isaac Watts.

This thorough revision of the 1850 edtion was prepared by various scholars and edited by Thomas J. Conant, Horatio B. Hackett, and Asahel C. Kendrick. It was first issued in parts, the Gospels appearing in 1862, and Acts through II Corinthians in 1863.

The Society had been formed by American Baptists in 1837, for the purpose of aiding Baptist missionary translators, and some prominent members wished to produce or sponsor a revision of the KJV. But others questioned the wisdom of the proposal. One man who was involved in these events, Thomas Armitage, reports that the Society's President and Secretary made this provisional edition on their own initiative after one member suggested that \"those in favor of a revision of the English Scriptures should issue, in the form of a small edition of the New Testament, a specimen of the character of the emendations which they desired .... Deacon William Colgate, the Treasurer, said that he approved of this suggestion, and that if Brethren Cone and Wyckoff would procure and issue such an edition as a personal enterprise, he, as a friend of revision, would personally pay the cost of the plates and printing. This was done, and in their preface they stated that .... they submitted their work, not for acceptance by the Society, but as a specimen of some changes which might be properly made, and that the plates would be presented to the Society if they were desired.\"<br><br>In the Preface of the 1850 edition, Cone and Wyckoff describe their purpose thus:<br><br>That the truth of God should be rendered plain to the ordinary reader, is a proposition which none but a Romanist will be disposed to deny. Ignorance of what his Maker has revealed, cannot benefit men, error and misconception must injure him. Every child of light will seek to know the truth, and will desire to make it known to others. By suitable efforts to enlighten his fellow creatures in the things of the kingdom, he promotes their welfare, and advances the declaratory glory of the Author of all truth. With these views and objects, the editors have prepared this amended edition of the New Testament, by diligently comparing it with the original Greek, availing themselves of the labors of learned and godly commentators of the last two hundred years, and submitting the emendations made to several eminent Biblical scholars. They do not pretend to have corrected every error and fault of the commonly received version; but they believe that they have removed many of its most objectionable blemishes, and have so far made \"a good translation better.\" This book is designed for the examination of the members of the American and Foreign Bible Society, to convince them that the common version can be corrected without injury to its characteristic excellencies, and with great enhancement of its real value. The plates have been made at the expense of a few benevolent individuals, and will be offered to the society, in connection with a proposition that a committee of learned brethren be appointed to correspond upon the subject of further emendations, and once a year to submit to the board those on which they unanimously agree. These, if approved by the board, may be introduced into the plates, and the business of rectification be thus gradually prosecuted, until the society is prepared to approve and adopt the book as a standard.<br><br>Read More http://www.bible-researcher.com/abu.html.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"US","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ENGAKJV","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1611, 2010","iso":"eng","title":"American King James Version","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain; Typesetting © 2010 American Bible Society.

The New Testament portion was published in Reims, France, in 1582, in one volume with extensive commentary and notes. The Old Testament portion was published in two volumes twenty-seven years later in 1609 and 1610 by the University of Douai. The first volume, covering Genesis through Job, was published in 1609; the second, covering Psalms to 2 Machabees plus the deuterocanonical books of the Vulgate, was published in 1610. Marginal notes took up the bulk of the volumes and had a strong polemical and patristic character. They offered insights on issues of translation, and on the Hebrew and Greek source texts of the Vulgate.<br><br>The purpose of the version, both the text and notes, was to uphold Catholic tradition in the face of the Protestant Reformation which up till then had dominated Elizabethan religion and academic debate. As such it was an effort by English Catholics to support the Counter-Reformation. The New Testament was reprinted in 1600, 1621 and 1633. The Old Testament volumes were reprinted in 1635 but neither thereafter for another hundred years. In 1589, William Fulke collated the complete Rheims text and notes in parallel columns with those of the Bishops' Bible. This work sold widely in England, being re-issued in three further editions to 1633. It was predominantly through Fulke's editions that the Rheims New Testament came to exercise a significant influence on the development of 17th century English.<br><br>Much of the text of the 1582/1610 bible employed a densely Latinate vocabulary, making it extremely difficult to read the text in places. Consequently, this translation was replaced by a revision undertaken by bishop Richard Challoner; the New Testament in three editions of 1749, 1750, and 1752; the Old Testament (minus the Vulgate apocrypha), in 1750. Although retaining the title Douay–Rheims Bible, the Challoner revision was a new version, tending to take as its base text the King James Version rigorously checked and extensively adjusted for improved readability and consistency with the Clementine edition of the Vulgate. Subsequent editions of the Challoner revision, of which there have been very many, reproduce his Old Testament of 1750 with very few changes. Challoner's New Testament was, however, extensively revised by Bernard MacMahon in a series of Dublin editions from 1783 to 1810. These Dublin versions are the source of some Challoner bibles printed in the United States in the 19th century. Subsequent editions of the Challoner Bible printed in England most often follow Challoner's earlier New Testament texts of 1749 and 1750, as do most 20th-century printings and on-line versions of the Douay–Rheims bible circulating on the internet.<br><br>Although the Jerusalem Bible, New American Bible Revised Edition, Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, and New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition are the most commonly used Bibles in English-speaking Catholic churches, the Challoner revision of the Douay–Rheims often remains the Bible of choice of more-traditional English-speaking Catholics.

Doddridge notes in the preface that he intended this commentary to be used by families at the dinner table. The forgotten practice of family worship is a great way to use this commentary; the expanded translation, and the devotions at the end of each section (see below) work together seamlessly as a perfect tool for family devotional reading and discussion. This may well be the book that Jonathan Edwards used for his family devotions.<br><br>The Family Expositor is an extraordinary work. Doddridge deems it “a paraphrase,” but it is much more than that.

In his preface, Thomas offers the book not only as a pleasing method of teaching Bible lessons to children, but as “an easy Way of leading them on in Reading.” Thomas learned the art of engraving while apprenticed in his youth to the Boston printer Zechariah Fowle. Based primarily in Worcester, Massachusetts, Thomas produced 65 children’s books and is widely acclaimed as America’s first enlightened printer of such books, often compared with John Newbery of London, England, with whom he shared the motto, “Instruction with delight.” The book was inscribed by its first owner, “Enoch Brooks’ Book, Princeton, March 13th, 1789.” It is one of four copies of the book known to exist today.

First of the two was the Cambridge edition of 1760, the culmination of 20 years' work by Francis Sawyer Parris, who died in May of that year. This 1760 edition was reprinted without change in 1762 and in John Baskerville's fine folio edition of 1763. This was effectively superseded by the 1769 Oxford edition, edited by Benjamin Blayney, though with comparatively few changes from Parris's edition; but which became the Oxford standard text, and is reproduced almost unchanged in most current printings. Parris and Blayney sought consistently to remove those elements of the 1611 and subsequent editions that they believed were due to the vagaries of printers, while incorporating most of the revised readings of the Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638, and each also introducing a few improved readings of their own. They undertook the mammoth task of standardizing the wide variation in punctuation and spelling of the original, making many thousands of minor changes to the text. In addition, Blayney and Parris thoroughly revised and greatly extended the italicization of \"supplied\" words not found in the original languages by cross-checking against the presumed source texts. Blayney seems to have worked from the 1550 Stephanus edition of the Textus Receptus, rather than the later editions of Theodore Beza that the translators of the 1611 New Testament had favoured; accordingly the current Oxford standard text alters around a dozen italicizations where Beza and Stephanus differ. Like the 1611 edition, the 1769 Oxford edition included the Apocrypha, although Blayney tended to remove cross-references to the Books of the Apocrypha from the margins of their Old and New Testaments wherever these had been provided by the original translators. Altogether, the standardization of spelling and punctuation caused Blayney's 1769 text to differ from the 1611 text in around 24,000 places. Since that date, a few further changes have been introduced to the Oxford standard text. The Oxford University Press paperback edition of the \"Authorized King James Version\" provides Oxford's standard text, and also includes the prefatory section \"The Translators to the Reader\".<br><br>The 1611 and 1769 texts of the first three verses from I Corinthians 13 are given below.<br><br>[1611] 1. Though I speake with the tongues of men & of Angels, and haue not charity, I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I haue the gift of prophesie, and vnderstand all mysteries and all knowledge: and though I haue all faith, so that I could remooue mountaines, and haue no charitie, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore, and though I giue my body to bee burned, and haue not charitie, it profiteth me nothing.<br><br>[1769] 1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.<br><br>There are a number of superficial edits in these three verses: 11 changes of spelling, 16 changes of typesetting (including the changed conventions for the use of u and v), three changes of punctuation, and one variant text—where \"not charity\" is substituted for \"no charity\" in verse two, in the erroneous belief that the original reading was a misprint.<br><br>A particular verse for which Blayney's 1769 text differs from Parris's 1760 version is Matthew 5:13, where Parris (1760) has<br><br>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and to be troden under foot of men.<br><br>Blayney (1769) changes 'lost his savour' to 'lost its savour', and troden to trodden.<br><br>For a period, Cambridge continued to issue Bibles using the Parris text, but the market demand for absolute standardization was now such that they eventually adapted Blayney's work but omitted some of the idiosyncratic Oxford spellings. By the mid-19th century, almost all printings of the Authorized Version were derived from the 1769 Oxford text—increasingly without Blayney's variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha. One exception to this was a scrupulous original-spelling, page-for-page, and line-for-line reprint of the 1611 edition (including all chapter headings, marginalia, and original italicization, but with Roman type substituted for the black letter of the original), published by Oxford in 1833. Another important exception was the 1873 Cambridge Paragraph Bible, thoroughly revised, modernized and re-edited by F. H. A. Scrivener, who for the first time consistently identified the source texts underlying the 1611 translation and its marginal notes. Scrivener, like Blayney, opted to revise the translation where he considered the judgement of the 1611 translators had been faulty. In 2005, Cambridge University Press released its New Cambridge Paragraph Bible with Apocrypha, edited by David Norton, which followed in the spirit of Scrivener's work, attempting to bring spelling to present-day standards. Norton also innovated with the introduction of quotation marks, while returning to a hypothetical 1611 text, so far as possible, to the wording used by its translators, especially in the light of the re-emphasis on some of their draft documents. This text has been issued in paperback by Penguin Books.<br><br>From the early 19th century the Authorized Version has remained almost completely unchanged—and since, due to advances in printing technology, it could now be produced in very large editions for mass sale, it established complete dominance in public and ecclesiastical use in the English-speaking Protestant world. Academic debate through that century, however, increasingly reflected concerns about the Authorized Version shared by some scholars: (a) that subsequent study in oriental languages suggested a need to revise the translation of the Hebrew Bible—both in terms of specific vocabulary, and also in distinguishing descriptive terms from proper names; (b) that the Authorized Version was unsatisfactory in translating the same Greek words and phrases into different English, especially where parallel passages are found in the synoptic gospels; and (c) in the light of subsequent ancient manuscript discoveries, the New Testament translation base of the Greek Textus Receptus could no longer be considered to be the best representation of the original text.<br><br>Responding to these concerns, the Convocation of Canterbury resolved in 1870 to undertake a revision of the text of the Authorized Version, intending to retain the original text \"except where in the judgement of competent scholars such a change is necessary\". The resulting revision was issued as the Revised Version in 1881 (New Testament), 1885 (Old Testament) and 1894 (Apocrypha); but, although it sold widely, the revision did not find popular favour, and it was only reluctantly in 1899 that Convocation approved it for reading in churches.<br><br>By the early 20th century, editing had been completed in Cambridge's text, with at least 6 new changes since 1769, and the reversing of at least 30 of the standard Oxford readings. The distinct Cambridge text was printed in the millions, and after the Second World War \"the unchanging steadiness of the KJB was a huge asset.\" The Cambridge edition is preferred by scholars.<br><br>The Authorized Version maintained its effective dominance throughout the first half of the 20th century. New translations in the second half of the 20th century displaced its 250 years of dominance (roughly 1700 to 1950), but groups do exist—sometimes termed the King James Only movement—that distrust anything not in agreement with the Authorized Version.

In 1803 he became a Universalist after spending a few years as a Baptist preacher. He stayed a Universalist for 26 years. It was during this period that his friend, Hosea Ballou, helped allay his doubts about the inspiration of Scripture, leading to his producing this translation. In 1829, he left the Universalists, moved to Boston, and founded a group of freethinkers. Here he enjoyed the friendship of men such as William Ellery Channing, Ralph Walso Emerson, Theodore Parker, and William Lloyd Garrison. In 1834 he was tried and convicted for blashphemy. After 4 years of appeals and litigation, he served 60 days. Simms says his trial and conviction were “utter absurdities, growing out of the narrowness of the day.” In 1839, hoping to found a freethinker colony, he moved to Iowa where he died in 1844.

He sets out the classic statement of parallelism, which remains the most fundamental category for understanding Hebrew poetry.

This idea has been influential in Old Testament Studies to the present day.<br><br>Between 1741 and 1750 Robert Lowth presented a series of groundbreaking lectures that reimagined the Hebrew Bible as literature, emphasizing its artful formal qualities. Today he is best known for rediscovering the parallelism of ancient Hebrew poetry, which he imagined as originating in the responsive singing of the seraphim. At a time when the divine authority of the Bible was waning, the reclassification of large swaths of prophecy as poetry helped Lowth extol the human figure of the prophet as a literary genius. Lowth idealized the prophetic-poetic text as “strong”: artful, controlled, ordered, and balanced. He responded to an anxiety about the place of the Bible and biblical prophecy in eighteenth-century English society by disavowing or minimizing the irregularities, stutters, and fissures in prophecy. But by introducing prophecy into poetry, Lowth—with much ambivalence—also ushered more passion, enthusiasm, and subjectivity into neoclassical English poetry.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GB","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ENGLOYD","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1905","iso":"eng","title":"Samuel Loyd Corrected New Testament","title_vernacular":"","copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"A Revision of the \"Authorised\" Version (By Nestle's Resultant Text), Prepared with the assistance of Eminent Scholars, and Issued by Samuel Lloyd","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"US","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ENGLSB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1853","iso":"eng","title":"Leeser Bible, Tanakh","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":2,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ENGLSV","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2020","iso":"eng","title":"English Literal Standard Version","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"© 2020 Covenant Press","guid":null,"description":"The Literal Standard Version of The Holy Bible is a registered copyright of Covenant Press and the Covenant Christian Coalition (© 2020).

It combined the New Testament of William Tyndale, and as much of the Old Testament as he had been able to translate before being captured and put to death. Myles Coverdale's translations, chiefly from German and Latin sources, completed the Old Testament and Biblical apocrypha, except for the Prayer of Manasseh, which was Rogers'. It is thus a vital link in the main sequence of English Bible translations.<br><br>Matthew's Bible was the combined work of three individuals, working from numerous sources in at least five different languages.<br><br>The entire New Testament (first published in 1526, later revised, 1534 and 1535), the Pentateuch, Jonah and in David Daniell's view, the Book of Joshua, Judges, Ruth, First and Second Samuel, First and Second Kings, and First and Second Chronicles, were the work of William Tyndale. Tyndale worked directly from the Hebrew and Greek, occasionally consulting the Vulgate and Erasmus’s Latin version, and he used Luther's Bible for the prefaces, marginal notes and the biblical text. The use of the pseudonym \"Thomas Matthew\" resulted possibly from the need to conceal from Henry VIII the participation of Tyndale in the translation. A theory exists that indicates the name Thomas Matthew, which in Greek means \"A twin to the original gift from God\", may have been chosen to indicate that the largest contributing author was indeed William Tyndale and that his writings were preserved.<br><br>The remaining books of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha were the work of Myles Coverdale. Coverdale translated primarily from German and Latin sources. Historians often tend to treat Coverdale and Tyndale like competitors in a race to complete the monumental and arduous task of translating the biblical text. One is often credited to the exclusion of the other. In reality they knew each other and occasionally worked together. Contemporary historian John Foxe states that they were in Hamburg translating the Pentateuch together as early as 1529.<br><br>The Prayer of Manasseh was the work of John Rogers. Rogers translated from a French Bible printed two years earlier (in 1535). Rogers compiled the completed work and added the preface, some marginal notes, a calendar and an almanac.<br><br>Of the three translators, two were burned at the stake. Tyndale was burned on 6 October 1536 in Vilvoorde, Belgium. John Rogers was \"tested by fire\" on 4 February 1555 at Smithfield, England; the first to meet this fate under Mary I of England. Myles Coverdale was employed by Cromwell to work on the Great Bible of 1539, the first officially authorized English translation of the Bible.<br><br>Time and extensive scholastic scrutiny have judged Tyndale the most gifted of the three translators. Dr. Westcott (in his History of the English Bible) states that \"The history of our English Bible begins with the work of Tyndale and not with that of Wycliffe.\" The quality of his translations has also stood the test of time, coming relatively intact even into modern versions of the Bible. A. S. Herbert, Bible cataloguer, says of the Matthew Bible, \"this version, which welds together the best work of Tyndale and Coverdale, is generally considered to be the real primary version of our English Bible\", upon which later editions were based, including the Geneva Bible and King James Version. Professor David Daniell recounts that, \"New Testament scholars Jon Nielson and Royal Skousen observed that previous estimates of Tyndale's contribution to the KJV 'have run from a high of up to 90% (Westcott) to a low of 18% (Butterworth)'. By a statistically accurate and appropriate method of sampling, based on eighteen portions of the Bible, they concluded that for the New Testament Tyndale's contribution is about 83% of the text, and in the Old Testament 76%. Thus the Matthew Bible, though largely unrecognized, significantly shaped and influenced English Bible versions in the centuries that followed its first appearance.

The Introduction neglects to mention the fact that the “Society” referred to on the title page was actually the Unitarian Society, and that the sole purpose of the version was to promote Unitarian ideas. The concealment of its true purpose was deliberate, as its principal editor later explained: “the editors … thought it needless to insert the word Unitarian in the title page, which would deter some ignorant and prejudiced people from looking into a work from which they might otherwise derive instruction.” 1 It soon became known, however, that the version was financed by the Unitarians and done mainly by Thomas Belsham, a notorious Unitarian controversialist.

The Introduction neglects to mention the fact that the “Society” referred to on the title page was actually the Unitarian Society, and that the sole purpose of the version was to promote Unitarian ideas. The concealment of its true purpose was deliberate, as its principal editor later explained: “the editors … thought it needless to insert the word Unitarian in the title page, which would deter some ignorant and prejudiced people from looking into a work from which they might otherwise derive instruction.” It soon became known, however, that the version was financed by the Unitarians and done mainly by Thomas Belsham, a notorious Unitarian controversialist. <br><br>Belsham, in an article published in 1820, explained that the “main object” of the version was “to serve as a sort of common-place book to the New Testament, by exhibiting to the inquiring and serious reader a plain and faithful account of the manner in which the most learned and approved Unitarian writers translate and explain the texts upon which the Unitarian controversy hinges, and the grounds of their interpretation.” This statement of the version’s purpose was also rather misleading, however, because Unitarianism, though it ostensibly based its doctrine upon interpretations of biblical texts, was not really based upon the Bible at all.

After a year of theological study in the Baptist Seminary at Rochester, he came to New Haven, and graduated from Yale Divinity School in 1880. He was pastor of the First Congregational Church in Buffalo for two years, and then for three years of the First Presbyterian Church in Watertown, N.Y. In 1883 he gained the degree of Ph.D. from Syracuse University. The years 1885-6 he spent as a student in Germany; and earned the degree of D.D. at Jena, where he studied especially under Lipsius. He was then called to the chair of New Testament criticism and interpretation at Yale, succeeding Dr. Dwight, who entered on the presidency of the university, in 1886. This chair he held until 1895, when he was chosen to succeed the late Dr. Samuel Harris as Dwight professor of systematic theology.<br><br>In 1892 Stevens had published a major study of Pauline theology, 2 and we might naturally expect to find in this paraphrase of Paul’s epistles a reflection of the interpretations set forth in his earlier treatise.

By this study is meant something more than an examination of style; it includes the thought-forms which lie behind style,—the moulds into which ideas are run.<br><br>This subject has never received sufficient attention. Interpreters have too often taken up the Pauline letters without reference to the environment in which they were produced, the peculiarities of the writer, or the special ends contemplated in his writings. Upon his words have been put meanings which belong to opinions and speculations which he never entertained, and around his teaching have been thrown associations wholly foreign to his own type of thought. Paul has been read as if he had written in the nineteenth century (or more commonly as if he had written in the fifth or seventeenth), and as if his writings had no peculiarities arising from his own time, education, and mental constitution.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"US","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ENGT4T","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2008-2016","iso":"eng","title":"Translation for Translators (2016)","title_vernacular":"Translation for Translators Bible","copyright":"© 2008-2016 Ellis W.

His reported discourses and the earliest accounts of his deeds were written down and circulated in that language. In what way these primitive records were related to our Four Gospels is a question which hitherto has not received any satisfactory answer. There is clear and complete evidence that the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John were composed in Aramaic on the basis of diverse written material widespread in Palestine, and that our Greek is the result of literal translation. There is very good reason to believe that Mk. was written in the year 40, Mt. a short time after. Each of these two Gospels was rendered into Greek very soon after its first appearance. The Gospel of Jn., composed in Palestine, presumably in Jerusalem, seems to have been soon carried away, to be translated into Greek many years later in a foreign land, perhaps at Ephesus. Luke compiled his Gospel from Semitic sources only, collected by himself and rendered into Greek with remarkable faithfulness. The document comprising the first two chapters was Hebrew, the rest Aramaic. The Greek text which is here followed is almost always that of Westcott and Hort. The test of translation seems to show that the text of Codex B stands very near indeed to that ofthe original translators.","description_short":null,"description_vernacular":"","description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"GB","copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":0},{"id":"ENGTOSB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2008","iso":"eng","title":"The Orthodox Study Bible","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ENGTRNCH","parent_bible_id":"ENGBFBS","gbc":null,"date":"1916","iso":"eng","title":"The Trench Epistles","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":"OPEN","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ENGTSB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1971","iso":"eng","title":"The Story Bible","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":null,"guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null},{"id":"ENGTVB","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"1539","iso":"eng","title":"Taverner's Bible","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"Public Domain","guid":null,"description":"Taverner's Bible, more correctly called The Most Sacred Bible whiche is the holy scripture, conteyning the old and new testament, translated into English, and newly recognized with great diligence after most faythful exemplars by Rychard Taverner, is a minor revision of Matthew's Bible edited by Richard Taverner and published in 1539.

He defended prophecy and miracle. He supported anointing the sick and touching for the king's evil.
