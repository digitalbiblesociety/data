One-party rule ended in 1995 with the first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s. Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition led to two contentious elections since 1995 which the ruling party won despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities. The formation of a government of national unity between Zanzibar's two leading parties succeeded in minimizing electoral tension in 2010.","overview":"Tanzania is an East African country known for its vast wilderness areas. They include the plains of Serengeti National Park a safari mecca populated by the “big five” game (elephant lion leopard buffalo rhino) and Kilimanjaro National Park home to Africa’s highest mountain. Offshore lie the tropical islands of Zanzibar with Arabic influences and Mafia with a marine park home to whale sharks and coral reefs.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":151,"land_mass_km":885800,"population_christian":31342000,"population_christian_percentage":61.4,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":242171,"population_migration":-40076,"population_year_change":2.98,"population_density_km":67,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":37,"population_literacy_percentage":"80.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"isn","translation_iso":"isn","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kiisanzu"},{"source_iso":"isn","translation_iso":"isn","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kinyihanzu"},{"source_iso":"isn","translation_iso":"isn","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kinyisanzu"}],"bibles":[{"id":"ISNDOR","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2020","iso":"isn","title":"Isanzu Bible","title_vernacular":null,"copyright":"© 2020 Door 43 International Mission Community","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":2,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":"TZ","copyright_type":"CCBYSA","reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[{"iso":"isn","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 1: Itunda Ingwandyo [Look, Listen & Live 1 Beginning with GOD]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65714","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65714","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 2: Iantu Nia Ngulu Yang'wi Tunda [Look, Listen & Live 2 Mighty Men of GOD]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65715","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 3: Uduli Kukeela Tunda [Look, Listen & Live 3 Victory through GOD]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65716","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 4: Mitumi Ang'wi Tunda [Look, Listen & Live 4 Servants of GOD]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65717","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 5: Muhenzo Wang'wi Tunda [Look, Listen & Live 5 On Trial for GOD]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65718","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 6: Uyesu - Ngwalimu Hange Mukomy [Look, Listen & Live 6 JESUS - Teacher & Healer]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65719","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 7: Uyesu - Isekulu Hange Mugun [Look, Listen & Live 7 JESUS - Lord & Saviour]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65720","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"LLL 8: Matendo Ang'wau Ng'welu [Look, Listen & Live 8 Acts of the HOLY SPIRIT]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65721","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Mpola Ninza [Good News]","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65713","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/65713","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"isn","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/2370","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/2370","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""}],"films":[]}
