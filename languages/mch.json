For most of the first half of the 20th century Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959. Under Hugo CHAVEZ president from 1999 to 2013 and his hand-picked successor President Nicolas MADURO the executive branch has exercised increasingly authoritarian control over other branches of government. At the same time democratic institutions have deteriorated threats to freedom of expression have increased and political polarization has grown. The ruling party's economic policies have expanded the state's role in the economy through expropriations of major enterprises strict currency exchange and price controls that discourage private sector investment and production and overdependence on the petroleum industry for revenues among others. Current concerns include: an increasingly politicized military rampant violent crime high inflation and widespread shortages of basic consumer goods medicine and medical supplies.","overview":"Venezuela is a country on the northern coast of South America with diverse natural attractions.
