The native Taino who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries were gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar cocoa and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter million slaves many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually increased its independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money laundering. Violent crime drug trafficking and poverty pose significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless many rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute substantially to the economy.","overview":"Jamaica a Caribbean island nation has a lush topography of mountains rainforests and reef-lined beaches. Many of its all-inclusive resorts are clustered in Montego Bay with its British-colonial architecture and Negril known for its diving and snorkeling sites. Jamaica is famed as the birthplace of reggae music and its capital Kingston is home to the Bob Marley Museum dedicated to the famous singer.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":10,"land_mass_km":10830,"population_christian":1784000,"population_christian_percentage":65.3,"population_catholic_percentage":2,"population_protestant_percentage":63.3,"population_refugee":1,"population_migration":-11332,"population_year_change":0.44,"population_density_km":273,"population_average_age":31,"population_urban_percentage":55,"population_literacy_percentage":"88.00","landmass":null,"region_code":12,"region_id":"419","region_name":"Latin America and the Caribbean"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"jls","translation_iso":"jls","dialect_id":null,"name":"JSL"}],"bibles":[],"resources":[],"films":[]}
