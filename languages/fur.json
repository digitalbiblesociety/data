An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.

Matìe (Il Vangelo secondo Matteo). It was translated into Friulian by Count Pietro dal Pozzo (volgarizzato in daletto Friulano dal Conte Pietro dal Pozzo). This gospel account was commissioned by Prince Louis Luciano Bonaparte. He was a great linguist who commissioned translations into lesser languages and dialects of Europe. He asked Pietro Zorutti to translate the gospel but he asked too much money, and he asked Abbott Iacopo Pirona, who recommended Conte (Count) Pietro dal Pozzo. Not much is known about him except that the had worked as an actuary at Udine from 1835 to 1844.\nThe Gospel was published in 1860, with 250 copies, by Strangeways amp Walden, of 28 Castle Street, Leicester Square, London. \nThis was digitised for the Bible Society with the help of MissionAssist in 2021.
