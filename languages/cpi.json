Germany annexed the island in 1888. A German-British consortium began mining the island's phosphate deposits early in the 20th century. Australian forces occupied Nauru in World War I; it subsequently became a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the world's smallest independent republic.","overview":"'Nauru is a tiny island country in Micronesia northeast of Australia. It features a coral reef and white-sand beaches fringed with palms including Anibare Bay on the east coast. Inland tropical vegetation surrounds Buada Lagoon. The rocky outcrop of Command Ridge the island''s highest point has a rusty Japanese outpost from WWII. The underground freshwater lake of Moqua Well lies amid the limestone Moqua Caves.'","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":9,"land_mass_km":20,"population_christian":null,"population_christian_percentage":null,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":763,"population_migration":null,"population_year_change":0.63,"population_density_km":541,"population_average_age":null,"population_urban_percentage":null,"population_literacy_percentage":"97.00","landmass":null,"region_code":1,"region_id":"57","region_name":"Micronesia"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"cpi","translation_iso":"cpi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Melanesian-Chinese Mixed Pidgin English"}],"bibles":[],"resources":[],"films":[]}
