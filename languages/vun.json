One-party rule ended in 1995 with the first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s. Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition led to two contentious elections since 1995 which the ruling party won despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities. The formation of a government of national unity between Zanzibar's two leading parties succeeded in minimizing electoral tension in 2010.","overview":"Tanzania is an East African country known for its vast wilderness areas. They include the plains of Serengeti National Park a safari mecca populated by the “big five” game (elephant lion leopard buffalo rhino) and Kilimanjaro National Park home to Africa’s highest mountain. Offshore lie the tropical islands of Zanzibar with Arabic influences and Mafia with a marine park home to whale sharks and coral reefs.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":0,"sil_language_count":151,"land_mass_km":885800,"population_christian":31342000,"population_christian_percentage":61.4,"population_catholic_percentage":null,"population_protestant_percentage":null,"population_refugee":242171,"population_migration":-40076,"population_year_change":2.98,"population_density_km":67,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":37,"population_literacy_percentage":"80.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan
