An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include sluggish economic growth high youth and female unemployment organized crime corruption and economic disparities between southern Italy and the more prosperous north.","overview":"'Italy a European country with a long Mediterranean coastline has left a powerful mark on Western culture and cuisine.

and  siciliano (in Italian), is a Romance language, spoken on the island of Sicily and neighbouring areas in southern Italy.\n\nScripture Portions: The first book of Scriptures in Sicilian were the books of Ruth (Libru di Ruth; italiano: Il Libro di Ruth) and the Song of Songs of Solomon (La Cantica di li Cantici; italiano: El Cantico de’ Cantici di Salomone) published in London 1860. These were followed by the Gospel of Matthew (Lu Santu Vancelu di Gesù Cristu Secunnu Matteu; italiano: Il Vangelo di S. Matteo) published in London 1861. They were translated into Sicilian by Luigi Scalia (volgarizzato in dialetto siciliano dall' Luigi Scalia).\n\nThe translations were commissioned by Prince Louis Luciano Bonaparte. He was a great linguist who commissioned translations into lesser languages and dialects of Europe. The Gospel of Matthew was also published with his linguistic comparative observations on the nature of Sicilian (Osservazioni linguistico-camparative sulla natura del siciliano). These portions were published in 1860 and 1861, with 250 copies, by Strangeways and Walden, of 28 Castle Street, Leicester Square, London. \n\nDigital Edition: These books were digitised for the Bible Society with the help of MissionAssist in 2021.
