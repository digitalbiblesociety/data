These differences complicated the establishment of a working political community after independence was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79) was responsible for the deaths of some 300000 opponents; guerrilla war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at least another 100000 lives. The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986 has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. A constitutional referendum in 2005 cancelled a 19-year ban on multi-party politics and lifted presidential term limits.","overview":"Uganda is a landlocked country in East Africa whose diverse landscape encompasses the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains and immense Lake Victoria. Its abundant wildlife includes chimpanzees as well as rare birds. Remote Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is a renowned mountain gorilla sanctuary. Murchison Falls National Park in the northwest is known for its 43m-tall waterfall and wildlife such as hippos.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":65,"land_mass_km":199810,"population_christian":29943000,"population_christian_percentage":88.6,"population_catholic_percentage":41.9,"population_protestant_percentage":46.7,"population_refugee":1359464,"population_migration":168694,"population_year_change":3.32,"population_density_km":229,"population_average_age":17,"population_urban_percentage":26,"population_literacy_percentage":"73.00","landmass":null,"region_code":7,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"kdi","translation_iso":"kdi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Akokolemu"},{"source_iso":"kdi","translation_iso":"kdi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Akum"},{"source_iso":"kdi","translation_iso":"kdi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Ikokolemu"},{"source_iso":"kdi","translation_iso":"kdi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Ikumama"},{"source_iso":"kdi","translation_iso":"kdi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kumam"},{"source_iso":"kdi","translation_iso":"kdi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kuman"},{"source_iso":"kdi","translation_iso":"kdi","dialect_id":null,"name":"Kumum"}],"bibles":[{"id":"KDIBSU","parent_bible_id":null,"gbc":null,"date":"2006, 2013","iso":"kdi","title":"Kumam Bible","title_vernacular":"Baibuli I Leb Kumam","copyright":"Â© Bible Society of Uganda","guid":null,"description":null,"description_short":null,"description_vernacular":null,"description_reviewed":0,"script":"Latn","versification":null,"numeral_system_id":"default","country_id":null,"copyright_type":null,"reviewed":0,"isbn13":null,"back_text":null,"cover":null,"questionable":null}],"resources":[{"iso":"kdi","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/8670","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/8670","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""}],"films":[]}
