        "introduction": "Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and 20th centuries 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65) in which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11 southern slave states and the Great Depression of the 1930s an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the end of the Cold War in 1991 the US remains the world's most powerful nation state. Since the end of World War II the economy has achieved relatively steady growth low unemployment and inflation and rapid advances in technology.",

            "description": "The Yupic translation project was split from the start. The Bering strait separated  the Yupic people and in 1959, when Wycliffe linguists Dave and Mitzi Shinen began their translation assignment to the Yupik-speaking Alaskan Eskimo, they were unable to collaborate with the Siberian Yupiks due to the Cold War being waged between the USSR and the USA. This changed in 1989, when a group of elated Yupiks from Siberia plowed their way through the freezing arctic sea in three walrus-skin boats to be reunited with their relatives at last.  During the time of separation, the Siberians had developed a written form of Yupik, just as the Shinens had done with the same language for the St. Lawrence Islanders. But the Siberians, who had learned to read their Yupik written with a Russian Cyrillic alphabet, could not read Yupik written in the Roman alphabet, developed by the Shinens. In 2018, Dave and Mitzi published the New Testament in both alphabets with help from Jim Brase.",
