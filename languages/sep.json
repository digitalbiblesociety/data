Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then. There have been increasing protests over the belief that the president may try to run for a currently unconstitutional third term in the 2015 presidential elections. Burkina Faso's high population growth and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens.","overview":"Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa. It covers an area of around 274200 square kilometres and is surrounded by six countries: Mali to the north; Niger to the east; Benin to the southeast.","independent":1,"wfb":1,"wfb_pdf":1,"sil_language_count":85,"land_mass_km":273600,"population_christian":3746000,"population_christian_percentage":22,"population_catholic_percentage":18,"population_protestant_percentage":4,"population_refugee":25868,"population_migration":-25000,"population_year_change":2.86,"population_density_km":76,"population_average_age":18,"population_urban_percentage":31,"population_literacy_percentage":"36.00","landmass":null,"region_code":8,"region_id":"202","region_name":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"translations":[{"source_iso":"sep","translation_iso":"sep","dialect_id":null,"name":"Sìcìré"},{"source_iso":"sep","translation_iso":"sep","dialect_id":null,"name":"Sìcìté"},{"source_iso":"sep","translation_iso":"sep","dialect_id":null,"name":"Sìpììté"},{"source_iso":"sep","translation_iso":"sep","dialect_id":null,"name":"Sucite"},{"source_iso":"sep","translation_iso":"sep","dialect_id":null,"name":"Tagba"}],"bibles":[],"resources":[{"iso":"sep","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Good News","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/29700","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/29700","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"The Living Christ","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/31481","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/31481","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78434","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78434","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 2 Mighty Men of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78435","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 3 Victory through GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78436","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 4 Servants of GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78437","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 5 On Trial for GOD","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78438","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 6 JESUS - Teacher & Healer","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78439","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 7 JESUS - Lord & Saviour","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78440","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":null,"type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Look, Listen & Live 8 Acts of the HOLY SPIRIT","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":null,"url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/78441","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""},{"iso":"sep","fab_view":"1","type":"audio","cover":"","title":"Words of Life","title_vernacular":null,"description":"","url_source":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/29691","url":"https://globalrecordings.net/en/program/29691","author":"Global Recordings Network","organization_id":"global-recordings-network","date":""}],"films":[]}
